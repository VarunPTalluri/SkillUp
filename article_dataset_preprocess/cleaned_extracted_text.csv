Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets. Economic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Metrics such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. Policymakers, most notably those at the Federal Reserve, use these indicators to determine not only where the economy is going but how fast it's getting there. The various government and non-profit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of presenting what would be logistically impossible for any investor to do by themselves. An indicator in its simplest form could be any piece of information that helps an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. There are also indexes for coincident indicators and lagging indicators. Once an investor understands how various indicators are calculated and their relative strengths and limitations, several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. Economic indicators allow investors to gain a better understanding of various economic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may be the most important indicator out there especially to equity investors who are focused on corporate profit growth. Since the GDP represents the sum of what our economy is producing, its growth rate is targeted to be in certain ranges. If numbers start to fall outside those ranges, fear of inflation or recession will grow in the markets. Many investors, especially those who invest primarily in fixed-income securities, are concerned about inflation. Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure, the most notable in this group are the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The data just is and that is hard to find these days. By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the stock market and the economy in which their dollars are invested and they can also be better prepared to revisit an investment thesis when the timing is right.""""""",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/economic_indicators.asp
