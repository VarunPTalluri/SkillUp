Economic indicators

are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Consistent in their release, wide in their scope and range, metrics such as the

Consumer Price Index

(CPI) and written reports like the

Beige Book

are free for all investors to inspect and analyze.

Policymakers, most notably those at the

Federal Reserve

, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going, but how fast it's getting there.

Although investors should get to know economic indicators, the reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw. In other words, information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and

asset allocation

. But there is valuable information in those raw data releases. The various government and nonprofit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, both of which can be very useful to individual investors.

What Is an Economic Indicator?

In its simplest form, an indicator could be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. The U.S. economy is essentially a living thing where, at any given moment, there are billions of moving parts—some acting, others reacting. This simple truth makes predictions extremely difficult. They must always involve a large number of assumptions, no matter what resources are put to the task. But with the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various

economic conditions

. There are also indexes for

coincident indicators

and

lagging indicators

—the components of each are based on whether they tend to rise during or after an economic expansion.﻿

Use in Tandem, Use in Context

Once an investor understands how various indicators are calculated and their

relative strengths

and limitations, several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. For example, in the area of employment, consider using data from several releases. By using the hours-worked data (from the

Employment Cost Index

) along with the

labor report

and

nonfarm payrolls

, investors can get a fairly complete picture of the state of the

labor market

.

Additionally, are increasing retail sales figures being validated by increased personal expenditures? Are new

factory orders

leading to higher factory shipments and higher

durable goods

figures? Are higher wages showing up in higher

personal income

figures? The savvy investor will look up and down the

supply chain

to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release.

Personalizing Your Research

Some people may prefer to understand a couple of specific indicators really well and use this expert knowledge to make investment plays based on their analyses. Others may wish to adopt a jack-of-all-trades approach, understanding the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. For example, a retired couple living on a combination of

pensions

and long-term

Treasury bonds

should be looking for different things than a

stock trader

who rides the waves of the

business cycle

. Most investors fall in the middle, hoping for stock market returns to be steady and near long-term historical averages (about 8% to 10% per year).

Knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful, as well as generally knowing the

macroeconomic

forecasts. Forecast numbers can be found at several public websites, such as Yahoo! Finance or MarketWatch. On the day a specific indicator release is made, there will be

press releases

from newswires such as the Associated Press and Reuters, which will present figures with key pieces highlighted.

It is helpful to read a report on one of the newswires, which may parse the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations,

seasonality

figures, and year-over-year results. For those that use

investment advisors

, these individuals will probably analyze recently released indicators in an upcoming newsletter or discuss them during upcoming meetings.

Inflation Indicators: Keeping a Watchful Eye

Many investors, especially those who invest primarily in

fixed-income securities

, are concerned about

inflation

. Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure. The most notable in this group are the

Producer Price Index

(PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

﻿

﻿﻿ Many investors will use the PPI to try and predict the upcoming CPI.

There is a proven statistical relationship between the two, as economic theory suggests that if producers of goods are forced to pay more in production, some portion of the price increase will be passed on to consumers. Each index is derived independently, but both are released by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics

(BLS). Other key inflationary indicators include the levels and

growth rates

of the

money supply

and the Employment Cost Index (ECI).

﻿

﻿﻿﻿

﻿

﻿﻿

Economic Output: Stock Investors Inquire Within

The

gross domestic product

(GDP) may be the most important indicator out there, especially to equity investors who are focused on

corporate profit

growth. Since the GDP represents the sum of what our economy is producing, its growth rate is targeted to be in certain ranges. If the numbers start to fall outside those ranges, fear of inflation or

recession

will grow in the markets. To get ahead of this fear, many people will follow the monthly indicators that can shed some light on the quarterly GDP report.

For example,

capital goods

shipments from the

Factory Orders Report

are used to calculate producers' durable equipment orders within the GDP report.

Indicators such as

retail sales

and

current account

balances are also used in the computations of GDP, so their release helps to complete part of the economic puzzle prior to the quarterly GDP release.

Other indicators that aren't part of the actual calculations for GDP are still valuable for their predictive abilities. Metrics such as wholesale inventories, the Beige Book, the

Purchasing Managers' Index

(PMI), and the labor report all shed light on how well our economy is functioning. With the assistance of all these monthly data, GDP estimates will begin to tighten up as the component data slowly gets released throughout the quarter. By the time the actual GDP report is released, there will be a general consensus of the figure that is remarkably accurate. If the actual results deviate much from the estimates, the markets will move, often with high

volatility

. If the number falls right into the middle of the expected range, then the markets and investors can collectively pat themselves on the back and let prevailing investing trends continue.

Mark Your Calendar

Sometimes indicators take on a more valuable role because they contain very timely data. The

Institute for Supply Management's

PMI report, for instance, is typically released on the first

business day

of every month.

﻿

﻿﻿ As such, it is one of the first pieces of aggregate data available for the month that just ended. While not as rich in detail as many of the indicators to follow, the category breakdowns are often picked apart for clues to things such as future labor report details (from the employment survey results) or wholesale inventories (inventory survey).

The relative order in which the indicators are presented does not change month to month, so investors may want to mark a few days on their monthly calendars to read up on the areas of the economy that might change how they think about their investments or

time horizon

.

﻿

﻿﻿ Overall, asset allocation decisions can fluctuate over time, and making such changes after a monthly review of macro indicators may be wise.

The Bottom Line

Benchmark pieces of economic indicator data arrive with no agenda or sales pitch. The data just

is,

and that is hard to find these days. By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the

stock market

and the economy in which their dollars are invested, and they can also be better prepared to revisit an

investment thesis

when the timing is right. While there is no one ""magic indicator"" that can dictate whether to buy or sell, using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter

portfolio management

for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor.

Describe Pricing Strategy Under Each Market Structure

10 Oct 2019

Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate.

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand, the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices.

Suppliers can only supply what the consumers can consume at given prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers and therefore operate for as long as production costs fall below revenue.

Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can successfully set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. Since there are many producers, this will not affect the market as a whole.

A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products.

Also, since there are many competitors, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices.

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy

Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars.

Generally, an optimal pricing strategy, in the long run, incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors.

Monopoly Market Structure

The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits, if you may, in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.

Question

In monopolistic competitive markets, firms:

A.  are price takers;

B.  react to the prices set by competitors; or

C.  set their own prices.

Solution

The correct answer is C.

In monopolistic competition, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.

Excelente para el FRM 2

Escribo esta revisión en español para los hispanohablantes, soy de Bolivia, y utilicé 

 AnalystPrep para dudas y consultas sobre mi preparación para el FRM nivel 2 (lo tomé una sola vez y aprobé muy bien), siempre tuve un soporte claro, directo y rápido, el material sale rápido cuando hay cambios en el temario de GARP, y los ejercicios y exámenes son muy útiles para practicar.

So helpful. I have been using the videos to prepare for the CFA Level II exam. The videos signpost the reading contents, explain the concepts and provide additional context for specific concepts. 

The fun light-hearted analogies are also a welcome break to some very dry content.



I usually watch the videos before going into more in-depth reading and they are a good way to avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content when you look at the readings.

A great curriculum provider. James sir explains the concept so well that rather than memorising it, you tend to intuitively understand and absorb them. 

Thank you ! Grateful I saw this at the right time for my CFA prep.

I have finished my FRM1 thanks to AnalystPrep. And now using AnalystPrep for my FRM2 preparation. Professor Forjan is brilliant. He gives such good explanations and analogies. And more than anything makes learning fun. A big thank you to Analystprep and Professor Forjan. 5 stars all the way!

Professor James' videos are excellent for understanding the underlying theories behind financial engineering / financial analysis. The AnalystPrep videos were better than any of the others that I searched through on YouTube for providing a clear explanation of some concepts, such as Portfolio theory, CAPM, and Arbitrage Pricing theory. Watching these cleared up many of the unclarities I had in my head. Highly recommended.

John Rotonti:

Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin.

Chris Hill:

I'm Chris Hill, and that was Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti. What are you buying when you buy a stock? No, really, what are you buying? Today John kicks off a two-part series on the basics of financial statements, including what goes into a balance sheet, how the sale of a burrito at

become shareholder equity, and how financial statements work together.

John Rotonti:

Fools, John Rotonti here. Today we are going to be talking about the three primary financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. Let's just start with the balance sheet really quickly. The balance sheet, Fools, is called the balance sheet because it must balance at all times, and the simple formula is assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity, and that must always balance. A must always equal L plus SE, assets equals liabilities plus shareholders equity. Let's just look at a quick example using Chipotle, ticker CMG. Chipotle has total assets, so assets of 6,653 million. Then it has total liabilities of 4,355.6 million and total shareholders' equity of 2,297.4 million. If you remember, A, assets, equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity. So if we take the liabilities of Chipotle of 4,355.6, and we add the shareholders' equity of 2,297.4, you will get the total assets of 6,653 to the penny. To the penny, Fools, the balance sheet must balance at all times. Assets must be equal liabilities plus shareholders' equity. Then, of course, we can reconfigure that basic formula to get shareholders' equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities. All we've done is move some variables from one side of the equation to the other. Shareholders' equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities. Assets minus liabilities is how you get shareholders' equity. If we do that again, if we take total assets of 6,653, and we subtract total liabilities of 4,355.6, you will get total shareholders' equity of 2,297.4. Now that is why it is called the balance sheet. The left-hand of that equation, A equals L plus SE, assets, is what the company owns; liabilities, what the company owes. Now, when you're looking at a balance sheet, it starts at the top of the balance sheet with the most liquid assets, and it moves down the balance sheet. As you move down the balance sheet, those assets become less liquid. The definition of liquidity is the speed and ease at which you could turn the asset into cold, hard cash. The very top line of the balance sheet is cash and cash equivalents. That's already cash. That's the most liquid, Fools. You don't need to convert it to cash. That's why it's at the top.

Then we move down the balance sheet, and we get things like account. I'm not going to go line for line because if I was teaching this class at an MBA level, I'll probably spend three or four full classes, just on the balance sheet. So I can't go line by line. But then you have things like accounts receivable, which is money owed to Chipotle that has not yet been paid. That's an asset. It is owed to Chipotle. Those receivables, when people buy on credit and stuff, they're going to receive those pretty quickly. So that's pretty liquid. It's going to be turned into cash pretty quickly. Inventories, the raw materials, the food that they plan to sell, you can turn that into cash pretty quickly too because we're talking about a restaurant here. Those raw fresh ingredients that Chipotle is known for, they're going to spoil. They're going to expire. They have to use those ingredients and sell them within a day or two or something like that. They can convert inventories, which is another asset to cash pretty quickly, so it's liquid. But then you move down that balance sheet, and you get things like property, plant, and equipment, literally, buildings, facilities, all of the expensive kitchen equipment they have, property, plant, equipment. They can't turn that into cash immediately. If they wanted to sell that stuff, they'd have to get a broker, find a buyer, write up some contracts, some agreement, it takes time. So it's less liquid. There's other long-term investments as well, such as goodwill.

Every company start with zero goodwill, believe it or not, zero goodwill. A company only gets goodwill on its balance sheet when it acquires another company and pays above book value. That's how you acquire goodwill. It's something that ends up on your balance sheet when you buy another company, and it's an asset. Then you have liabilities. You have payables. That's money that you owe, but you have not paid yet. You have short-term debt. You have short-term leases, then you have long-term leases. You have long-term debt. There are other liabilities as well, but once again, you move from the most liquid down through the balance sheet to the least liquid. Now shareholders' equity has two other names. They all mean the same thing. They're synonyms. Shareholders' equity is also book value. How do you calculate book value? Total assets minus total liabilities. Book value is literally the value of your assets, what you own minus your total liabilities, what you owe. The other synonym for total equity is net worth. This is the company's net worth. Just like you can calculate your personal net worth based on your total assets, what you own, minus your total liabilities, what you owe. So total shareholders equity is equal to book value is equal to net worth. One last thing before I move on to the next financial statement. Think of assets, as we've said, that's what you own, that's the left-hand side of that equation. The other side of the equation, liabilities and shareholders' equity is the sources of funds to buy those assets. Think about it this way. This is going to be exciting. Assets are the uses of the funds. That's the uses of the funds. The company takes the right-hand side of the equation, the liabilities, i.e, debt, and shareholders' equity, i.e, what owners contribute. Those are the two primary sources of funds, and the company takes those to buy or build assets, the left-hand side of the equation, the uses of those funds. That's the balance sheet, Fools, called the balance sheet because it must balance at all times.

We're going to switch over to the income statement really quickly, sticking with Chipotle here. Some people call this the profit and loss statement, the P&L. We went over this in a prior segment, but it's important to review again because we're going to need it for when we get to the cash flow statement. So bear with me really quickly. The sale or revenue, think of those words as synonyms. I think a lot of companies that actually sell a tangible product use the word sales, and companies like software that don't sell tangible product that you can touch and feel use the word revenue. Think of sales for products, and revenue for software and services. But honestly, I've seen product companies use the word revenue, and I've seen software and services company use word sales. It doesn't matter. Honestly, sales and revenue are the exact same thing, and they are the top line of the income statement. They are the top line because they are at the top of the piece of paper. The sale is what happens at the point of sale.

In Chipotle's case, it is when the customer goes into the store, and orders, and pays for it at the point of sale system. These things used to be called cash registers. Now they're like little square iPads or whatever, but it's a point of sale computer system, called a POS, or when someone orders online and press ""Buy"" online, that's the point of sale. That is the sale. So you go into Chipotle, you buy a $7 chicken burrito or whatever and a drink. I think the average chicken at Chipotle is probably somewhere around $12 with tax, all in, I think. But let's just use a $7 burrito, that's the sale. From that, we subtract the cost of goods sold. That is all of the input costs as well as the employee wages that go into making that burrito. This does not include the salary of the CEO, and the COO, and everything else back at headquarters. This includes the people working in the Chipotle kitchen, on the frontline, on the backline, contributing in making that burrito. Those are wages that are included in cost of goods sold. It also includes all of the food, all the raw materials, all the ingredients. You got to have the chicken, or whether it's beef, or pork, whatever you're putting in your burrito. Avocados, those things are expensive. Those things are going through the moon. Avocados, tomatoes, onions, other basil, and spices that go into their spices and their sauces. Lettuce, I said onions, peppers. The chips, can't go to Chipotle without getting those chips, right? The tortillas, the wraps, anything that they need to make that Chipotle goes in that cost of goods sold. You take revenue, the $7 burrito, you subtract your cost of goods sold, and you get a number called gross profit. This is what we talk about when we're talking about unit economics.

If a company can price its products higher than its input costs, it will generate a gross product at the burrito level. That's the unit level. So that's its gross profit. Now, if you want to calculate the gross, we just said gross profit, sales minus cost of goods sold, you get gross profit. If you want to calculate the gross profit margin, you simply take that absolute gross profit dollar amount, the gross profits, and divide it by sales. When you are calculating a margin, you simply take the profit dollar amount that you're looking at and scale it by sales, divide it by sales. So gross profit margin is gross profit divided by sales. Now when you're talking about gross profit, you are talking about unit economics, you're also talking about pricing power. What if sales grow a little faster than cost of goods sold grow? You know the answer. That means your gross profit margin is going to increase over time, a sign of pricing power. Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power, and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin. So we have gross profit. From that, we subtract operating expenses. You got to keep the lights on. You got to pay your utilities. You got to pay your water bill. You have to pay all of the other salaries and expenses back at headquarters, if there's research and development, the research and development cost to come up with new recipes, sales and marketing. So R&D, research and development, sales and marketing, all of these things are operating expenses. These are cost of doing business. That's operating expenses. So gross profit, you subtract these operating expenses, you got to keep your lights on, you get operating income.

Now if you haven't been paying attention, you should start now. Operating income is also called earnings before interest and taxes, E-B-I-T or EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes. That's operating income. From operating income or EBIT, E-B-I-T, we subtract the interest expense on the debt, if the company has any debt, of which Chipotle does. Notice debt holders get paid first. They have a primary claim on a company's cash flows. There is a packing order, Fools, to who gets paid. Debt holders, or creditors, they get paid first. We just paid the I, the interest expense. Remember, we had E-B-I-T. We just pay the interest, so now we are left with E-B-T, earnings before taxes. So who gets paid next? The government in the form of taxes. So debt holders get paid first, and then the government in the form of taxes. Now what is left over after the company has paid its cost of goods sold, after the company has paid all of those other operating expenses, utility bills, research and development, sales and marketing, after the company has paid its interest on its debt, if it has any, after the company has paid its taxes to the government, if there is money left over, that is called net income, or net profit, or net earnings.

The three words mean the same thing, and that, Fools, is what you are buying as a shareholder. We get the residual claim of what is left over after all of those expenses we just went through are paid. We get residual claim. We get the bottom line. Why is it called the bottom line? Because it is at the bottom of the income statement. We get what is leftover. We have a residual claim on a company's cash flows. When you buy a stock, legally, what are you buying? When you buy a stock, you are buying a claim on the company's future net income, or future net profits, or future net earnings. You are buying a very small percentage of the company's future net income. That, Fools, is the income statement. Now why do I want to go through that? Because when you buy a stock, that's what you're legally buying, but also because we need to go to the cash flow statement, the third financial statement. Now remember how I just said net income is the bottom line of the cash flow statement? Guess what, net income, the same exact number that's on that income statement, then becomes the top line of the cash flow statement. [MUSIC] This is critical to understand. This is critical. The bottom line of the income statement, net income, becomes the top line of the cash flow statement.
