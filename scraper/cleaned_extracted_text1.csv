1,1,"""""""Economic Indicators You Should Know for Investment. Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets. Economic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Policymakers, most notably those at the Federal Reserve, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going but how fast it is getting there. Although investors should get to know economic indicators, there are valuable information in those raw data releases. What Is an Economic Indicator: an indicator could be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. The U.S. economy is a living thing where at any given moment there are billions of moving parts, some acting, others reacting. This simple truth makes predictions extremely difficult. But with the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various economic conditions.Use in Tandem Use in Context: Several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision-making. A savvy investor will look up and down the supply chain validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release. Economic Output Stock Investors Inquire Within: The gross domestic product (GDP) may be the most important indicator out there, especially to equity investors who are focused on corporate profit growth. If the numbers start to fall outside certain ranges, fear of inflation or recession will grow in the markets. A number of indicators are able to shed some light on the quarterly GDP report. By the time the actual GDP report is released there will be a general consensus of the figure that is remarkably accurate. The Bottom Line: Benchmark pieces of economic indicator data arrive with no agenda or sales pitch. By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the stock market and the economy in which their dollars are invested and they can also be better prepared to revisit an investment thesis when the timing is right. While there is no one magic indicator that can dictate whether to buy or sell, using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter portfolio management for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor.""""""",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/economic_indicators.asp
2,2,"""Financial Markets Role in the Economy Importance Types and Examples Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automatic Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets. What Are Financial Markets? Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs, including the stock market, bond market, forex market, and derivatives market. Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies. Understanding the Financial Markets Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of capitalist economies by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs. The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings. Types of Financial Markets There are several different types of markets. Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it. Stock Markets Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets. These are venues where companies list their shares which are bought and sold by traders and investors. Over-the-Counter Markets, Bond Markets A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate. Money Markets Typically, the money markets trade in products with highly liquid short-term maturities less than one year and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets. Derivatives Markets. Forex Market The forex foreign exchange market is where participants can buy, sell, hedge, and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs. Commodities Markets Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities. Cryptocurrency Markets Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally. The Bottom Line Financial markets provide liquidity, capital, and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability. Without financial markets, capital could not be allocated efficiently and economic activity such as commerce and trade, investments, and growth opportunities would be greatly diminished.""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp

5,5,"""The 503020 Budget Rule Explained With Examples. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren popularized the 502030 budget rule in her book All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan. The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50 on needs, 30 on wants, and 20 on savings. This intuitive and straightforward rule can help you draw up a reasonable budget that you can stick to over time in order to meet your financial goals. 

Key Takeaways: The rule states that you should spend up to 50 of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do. The remaining half should be split up between 20 savings and debt repayment and 30 to everything else that you might want. The rule is a template that is intended to help individuals manage their money and save for emergencies and retirement. The purpose of the 503020 rule is to balance paying for necessities while being mindful of long-term savings and retirement.

50 Needs: Needs are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for survival. Half of your after-tax income should be all that you need to cover your needs and obligations. 

30 Wants: Wants are all the things you spend money on that are not absolutely essential. Anything in the wants bucket is optional if you boil it down. 

20 Savings: Finally, try to allocate 20 of your net income to savings and investments.

Importance of Savings: Americans are notoriously bad at saving and the nation has extremely high levels of debt. The rule is intended to help individuals manage their after-tax income, primarily to have funds on hand for emergencies and savings for retirement. 

Benefits of the 503020 Budget Rule: The rule can guide individuals to financial prosperity in a number of different ways. 

How to Adopt the 503020 Budget Rule: No single way of tracking to a budget will work for everyone. However, here are some high-level tips on adopting a 503020 budget relevant to all individuals.

Example of the 503020 Budget Rule: Imagine a person recently graduated from college and started her first full-time job. She wants to develop good financial habits from the beginning and has heard about the 503020 budget rule. 

Can I Modify the Percentages in the 503020 Rule to Fit My Circumstances: Yes, you can modify the percentages in the 503020 rule based on your circumstances and priorities.

The Bottom Line: Saving is difficult and life often throws unexpected expenses at us. By following the 50-20-30 rule, individuals have a plan with how they should manage their after-tax income.""",https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp

If you're just gettingstarted with investing here's what you need to know. If you've decided to start investing --congratulations. By setting aside some of your money now in investments that could appreciate over time you'll set yourself up for greater financial security in the future.
Now that you've decided that you want to invest it's important to devote some time to learning how to invest.
Why should I invest
The easy answer to the question is to create wealth. As awhole stock investments have historically returned more than 9 per year on average. If you invested 10000 at this return rate for 40 years it would grow to nearly 315000. Investing can help you reach your financial goals such as paying for your children's college education passing wealth to loved ones or building a nest egg for your own retirement.
There are many potential reasons to invest money.
Asset allocation Stocks vs. bonds vs. cash
Since stocks are highly volatile but have the most return potential they are more appropriate for younger investors. In contrast bonds are designed for predictability making them better for older investors with lower risk tolerance. Cash investments are typically not a good idea unless you have lots of near-term liquidity needs. Determining the appropriate asset allocation for your investment strategy is a critical step to take.
Should I invest actively or passively There are two main methods of investing. Active investment refers topicking individual stocks and bonds or buying mutual funds that are actively managed by professionals. In other words an active investor's goal is to beat the market.
Passive investing means simply trying to match the market's performance generally through funds that track indexes. The question you need to answer is how much time you want to spend on investing. If you have the time and desire to research individual stocks active investment could be the way to go.
How to choose stocks to invest in If you choose to invest in individual stocks the first thing you should understand is the difference between investing and speculating.
Investing is a long-term activity designed to achieve sustained returns that can compound over time. Speculating is a kin to gambling --trying to chase a quick payday.

9,9,"""""""Risk. All investments carry some degree of risk. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds can lose value, even their entire value, if market conditions sour. Even conservative, insured investments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a bank or credit union come with inflation risk. That is, they may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.

What Is Risk? When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to negatively impact your financial welfare. 

Risk and Reward. The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class typically correlates with the level of return the investment might achieve. The rationale behind this relationship is that investors willing to take on risky investments and potentially lose money should be rewarded for their risk. 

Time Can Be Your Friend or Foe. Based on historical data, holding a broad portfolio of stocks over an extended period of time significantly reduces your chances of losing your principal. However, the historical data should not mislead investors into thinking that there is no risk in investing in stocks over a long period of time.

Managing Risk. You cannot eliminate investment risk. But two basic investment strategies, asset allocation and diversification, can help manage both systemic risk (risk affecting the economy as a whole) and non-systemic risk (risks that affect a small part of the economy or even a single company). Hedging (buying a security to offset a potential loss on another investment) and insurance products can provide additional ways to manage risk.

The bottom line is that all investments carry some degree of risk. By better understanding the nature of risk and taking steps to manage those risks, you put yourself in a better position to meet your financial goals.""""""

Saving in 401k plans and individual retirement accounts can help. Introduction. Saving for retirement is the gnarliest of delayed gratification challenges. Tucking money away today in retirement accounts with the intention you won't touch it for decades is not a habit that most brains are hard-wired to embrace. But save we must. For most people, Social Security benefits won't cover all the bills in retirement. To land in retirement in solid financial shape, you also want to build your own savings in 401k plans and individual retirement accounts. It's never too early to get started. Hint: compound growth is your best investing friend. Nor is it ever too late to make progress. Another hint: Worried you won't have enough retirement income? Consider ways to reduce your spending needs in retirement. Like any big goal, breaking it down into manageable bite-size pieces keeps the task from veering into overwhelming. Focusing on a few key moves in each decade will set you up for a successful retirement.

In your 20s: Cash in on compound growth, aim to save 10% of your gross salary, focus on Roth options. In your 30s: Stay or get focused, aim to save at least 15% of your gross salary. In your 40s: Monitor your spending, aim to save about 4x your salary, be on high alert for lifestyle creep. In your 50s: Plan your retirement income, aim to save about 8x your salary. In your 60s: Focus on your age 90-plus future self, plan on a 30-year retirement

About one in three people have been contacted by a creditor or collector seeking to collect a debt within the past year. There are resources available to help you pay off what you owe. Consider working with a credit counselor. Credit counselors can advise you on ways to manage your money and debt and help you create and follow a budget, which can help you save or pay off a debt. Credit counselors are usually nonprofit organizations. A counselor may offer free educational materials and workshops, review your budget and come up with a plan to address your money problems, help you decide which debts to pay first and understand what can happen if you stop making payments, make an up-front agreement with your creditors to stop collections and not charge you late fees while you are in a debt management program. Beware of debt settlement companies that charge up-front fees in return for promising to settle your debts. Dealing with debt settlement companies can be risky; you may end up in more debt than when you started. Paying off debt can be a long journey. We have additional information about working with debt collectors, including sample letters you can use for your own situation.

15,15,"""Market Structure - Overview, Definition, Features and Types. Market structure in economics refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for goods and services. It is based on the characteristics that influence the behavior and outcomes of companies working in a specific market. Some of the factors that determine a market structure include the number of buyers and sellers, ability to negotiate, degree of concentration, degree of differentiation of products, and the ease or difficulty of entering and exiting the market.

Summary: Market structure refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods. The four popular types of market structures include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition. Market structures show the relations between sellers and other sellers, sellers to buyers or more. 

In economics, market structures can be understood by examining features exhibited by different players. It is common to differentiate these markets across the following seven distinct features:
- The industry's buyer structure
- The turnover of customers
- The extent of product differentiation
- The nature of costs of inputs
- The number of players in the market
- Vertical integration extent in the same industry
- The largest player’s market share

Economists have used this information to describe four distinct types of market structures: perfect competition, oligopoly, monopolistic competition, and monopoly. 

1. Perfect Competition: Large number of small companies competing against each other, selling similar products, lack price influence over the commodities and are free to enter or exit the market.

2. Monopolistic Competition: Imperfectly competitive market with traits of both monopoly and competitive market. Sellers can differentiate their goods in terms of quality and branding. 

3. Oligopoly: Consists of a small number of large companies selling differentiated or identical products. Since there are few players, their competitive strategies are dependent on each other. 

4. Monopoly: A single company that has no competitor and is the sole seller of products in the entire market.

17,17,"""""""PricingStrategyUnderEachMarketStructure
Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate. 
Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy
This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand, the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices. Suppliers can only supply what the consumers can consume at given prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers and therefore operate for as long as production costs fall below revenue.
Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy
In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can successfully set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. Since there are many producers, this will not affect the market as a whole. A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products. Also, since there are many competitors a firm won't be affected by another firm's strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices.
Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy
Here prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars. Generally, an optimal pricing strategy in the long run incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors. 
Monopoly Market Structure
The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or change consumer behavior in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.
Question
In monopolistic competitive markets, firms set their own prices.
Solution
The correct answer is B. In monopolistic competition, a firm won't be affected by another firm's strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.""""""",https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/economics/pricing-strategy-under-each-market-structure/

The meaningful interpretation and analysis of balance sheets income statements and cash flow statements to discern a company's investment qualities is the basis for smart investment choices. However the diversity of financial reporting requires that we first become familiar with certain financial statement characteristics before focusing on individual corporate financials. In this article we'll show you what the financial statements have to offer and how to use them to your advantage. Key Takeaways Understanding how to read a company's financial statements is a key skill for any investor wanting to make smart investment choices. There are four sections to a company's financial statements the balance sheet the income statement the cash flow statement and the explanatory notes. Prudent investors might also want to review a company's 10-K which is the detailed financial report the company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. An investor should also review non-financial information that could impact a company's return such as the state of the economy the quality of the company's management and the company's competitors. Financial Statement Scorecard The financial statements used in investment analysis are the balance sheet the income statement and the cash flow statement with additional analysis of a company's shareholder's equity and retained earnings. Financial Statements to Use The numbers in a company's financial statements reflect the company's business products services and macro-fundamental events. These numbers and the financial ratios or indicators derived from them are easier to understand if you can visualize the underlying realities of the fundamentals driving the quantitative information. What's Behind the Numbers. Understanding Financial Jargon The presentation of a company's financial position as portrayed in its financial statements is influenced by management's estimates and judgments. Accounting Art Not Science. Both methods are legal in the United States although GAAP is most commonly used. Key Accounting Conventions Information on the state of the economy the industry competitive considerations market forces technological change the quality of management and the workforce are not directly reflected in a company's financial statements. Non-Financial Information The absolute numbers in financial statements are of little value for investment analysis unless these numbers are transformed into meaningful relationships to judge a company's financial performance and gauge its financial health. The resulting ratios and indicators must be viewed over extended periods to spot trends. Please beware that evaluative financial metrics can differ significantly by industry, company size, and stage of development. Financial Ratios and Indicators. Analysts and investors alike universally agree that a thorough understanding of the notes to financial statements is essential to properly evaluate a company's financial condition and performance. Notes to Financial Statements. Prudent investors should only consider investing in companies with audited financial statements which are a requirement for all publicly-traded companies. The 10-K is reported directly to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC and tends to contain more details than other reports. The Annual Report 10-K. Financial statements provide investors with information about a company's financial position helping to ensure corporate transparency and accountability. Understanding how to interpret key financial reports such as a balance sheet and cash flow statement helps investors assess a company's financial health before making an investment. Investors can also use information disclosed in the financial statements to calculate ratios for making comparisons against previous periods and competitors. What Key Financial Statements Should I Understand When Analyzing a Company. Both methods differ in how they report asset values depreciation and inventory. GAAP typically requires more disclosures than IFRS with the latter providing much less overall detail. What's the Difference Between GAAP and IFRS Accounting Conventions. Financial statements only provide a snapshot of a company's financial situation at a specific point in time. They also don't consider non-financial information such as the health of the broader economy and other factors such as income inequality or environmental sustainability. What are Some Key Limitations of Using Financial Statements. However it's also important to understand the limitations of overly relying on financial statements and consider other metrics such as the impact of non-financial information when analyzing a company's overall financial position. Financial statements play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the financial system and promoting trust between companies and investors.""""""",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/financialreporting.asp

This is a two-part series on the basics of financial statements, including what goes into a balance sheet, how the sale of a burrito at Chipotle becomes shareholder equity and how financial statements work together. The main focus is on the three primary financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash flow statement.

23,23,"""""""Net present value definition. What is Net Present Value? Net present value is an analysis tool used to decide whether to invest in a capital asset. It is employed as part of the capital budgeting process. A desirable investment is one that yields a positive net present value which implies that a business will receive excess cash over time as a result of the investment. A negative net present value indicates that a company will lose money on a proposed investment. A negative net present value is usually grounds to terminate an investment that is under consideration.

How to Calculate Net Present Value? Net present value is calculated as the difference between the present value of one or more inbound cash flows and one or more outbound cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology is used to derive present value using a discount rate as the basis for the discounting. The discount rate is typically based on the cost of capital of the business running the analysis.

Advantages of Net Present Value. A key benefit of net present value is that it reduces the cash flows associated with a project to one numeric value which can be easily compared to the net present values of other projects.

Disadvantages of Net Present Value. Net present value is not a perfect analysis tool for it suffers from several problems. First, estimated cash flows rarely match actual results. Second, the discount rate used for a capital asset analysis may not be appropriate given the incremental cost of the capital required to fund a project. And finally, an investment based on a net present value analysis only looks at the circumstances of a specific investment rather than the entire system of profit generation.

24,24,"""""""5 Methods for Capital Budgeting Capital budgeting is defined as the process used to determine whether capital assets are worth investing in. Capital assets are generally only a small portion of a company's total assets but they are usually long-term investments like new equipment, facilities, and software upgrades. By incorporating strategically planned capital budgeting into their financial processes, companies can more effectively determine and prioritize which projects, programs, and other investment assets could be most financially beneficial in the long-term. 

The five primary methods of capital budgeting are:

1) Internal Rate of Return
The internal rate of return calculation is used to determine whether a particular investment is worthwhile by assessing the interest that should be yielded over the course of a capital investment.

2) Net Present Value
Net present value (NPV) is used for the same purpose as the internal rate of return: analyzing the projected returns for a potential investment or project.

3) Profitability Index
The profitability index is a capital budgeting tool designed to identify the relationship between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was successful.

4) Accounting Rate of Return
The accounting rate of return is the projected return that an organization can expect from a proposed capital investment. 

5) Payback Period
The payback period is a unique capital budgeting method. Specifically, the payback period is a financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been invested.

Each method has its own limitations and strengths, and is typically used in conjunction with at least one other budgeting metric to decide the best course of action when firms are planning their next significant capital investment. Understanding and applying these methods effectively can help companies make profitable long-term investment decisions.""""""",https://online.norwich.edu/online/about/resource-library/5-methods-capital-budgeting

27,27,"""Financial modeling is the application of data analysis to predict business performance, manage assets and track cash flow. It's a vital tool essential for a business to succeed, whether it's a start-up or a Fortune 500 company. A financial modeling course can familiarize you with the concepts and strategies vital to business success. Research analysts, investment bankers, accountants, and entrepreneurs use financial modeling to better understand a company's performance before making important business decisions. Financial models are generated using MS Excel and can help you accomplish a variety of important tasks such as forecasting business performance, budgeting, asset management, and understanding cash flow.

There are several different types of financial models used by professionals to help them make the best business decisions. These models help professionals make important business decisions about raising capital, forecasting business changes and requirements, or what it will take to grow a business. Some examples of these useful financial models are the discounted cash flow (DCF) a valuation method used to determine the worth of investing in a business, leveraged buyout (LBO) which examines the impact of funding an acquisition with debt, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) a method that analyzes the result of acquiring or merging with another company. 

Investment bankers assist corporations and individual investors by making critical decisions to best ensure the success of their business and financial growth. They work in four areas of the financial services industry: capital markets, advisory, trading and brokerage, and asset management. Investment bankers usually work for investment banks that serve business clients. These banks are not like traditional commercial banks, they provide guidance and expertise to corporate clients seeking to issue an IPO (initial public offering) to raise capital that they could use to expand a business, acquire or merge with another company.

Balance sheets help business owners, investment bankers, and accountants understand the assets of a business. It outlines what the business owns or its assets, as well as what the business owes or its debt and liabilities. The income statement tells you how much profit a company generated during a certain period. The statement of cash flows provides insight into how effectively the organization manages its operations. Businesses use a statement of cash flow to understand a company's performance more specifically to assess a company's ability to generate cash from operations, financing and investing.""",https://www.udemy.com/topic/financial-modeling/

What Is Risk Management? Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. It is the process of monitoring and dealing with the financial risks associated with investing. Risk management occurs when an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment, such as a moral hazard, and then takes the appropriate action, or inaction, to meet their objectives and risk tolerance. 

Key Takeaways: Risk management is the process of identification, analysis, and acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decisions. Risk is inseparable from return in the investment world. Risk management strategies include avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction. One of the tactics to ascertain risk is standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of dispersion around a central tendency.

Investors often want to know the losses that come with an investment as well as how much an asset deviates from its expected outcome. Value at risk (VAR) tries to quantify the degree of loss associated with an investment with a given level of confidence over a defined period. 

The Bottom Line: Risk is an important part of the financial world. The word often brings up feelings of negativity since there is the potential for capital and investment loss. But risk isn't always bad because investments that have more risk often come with the biggest rewards. Knowing what the risks are, how to identify them, and employing suitable risk management techniques can help mitigate losses while you reap the rewards.""""""

The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold. Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via over-the-counter OTC marketplaces that operate under a defined set of regulations. Both stock market and stock exchange are often used interchangeably. Traders in the stock market buy or sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that are part of the overall stock market. The leading U.S. stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and the Nasdaq.

Key Takeaways Stock markets are venues where buyers are sellers meet to exchange equity shares of public corporations. Stock markets are components of a free-market economy because they enable democratized access to investor trading and exchange of capital. Stock markets create efficient price discovery and efficient dealing. The U.S. stock market is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and local regulatory bodies.

The stock market allows buyers and sellers of securities to meet interact and transact.The markets allow for price discovery for shares of corporations and serve as a barometer for the overall economy. Buyers and sellers are assured of a fair price high degree of liquidity and transparency as market participants compete in the open market. The first stock market was the London Stock Exchange which began in a coffeehouse where traders met to exchange shares in 1773. The first stock exchange in the United States began in Philadelphia in 1790. The Buttonwood Agreement so named because it was signed under a buttonwood tree marked the beginning of New York's Wall Street in 1792.

The stock market ensures price transparency, liquidity, price discovery, and fair dealings in trading activities. The stock market guarantees all interested market participants have access to data for all buy and sell orders thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. The market also ensures efficient matching of appropriate buy and sell orders. Most nations have a stock market and each is regulated by a local financial regulator or monetary authority or institute. The SEC is the regulatory body charged with overseeing the U.S. stock market.

The stock market is a component of a free-market economy. It allows companies to raise money by offering stock shares and corporate bonds and allows investors to participate in the financial achievements of the companies make profit through capital gains and earn income through dividends. The stock market works as a platform through which savings and investments of individuals are efficiently channeled into productive investment opportunities and add to the capital formation and economic growth of the country.

A grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) is a special type of irrevocable trust that allows the trustmaker (grantor) to gamble against the odds. If the trustmaker (grantor) plays his cards right then a significant amount of wealth can move down to the next generation with virtually no estate or gift tax ramifications.

How Does a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) Work?

Here is a general overview of how a GRAT works:

The trustmaker (grantor) transfers specific assets into the name of the GRAT and as the name suggests, retains the right to receive an annual annuity payment for a certain number of years. When the term of the GRAT ends, what is left in the GRAT is distributed to the trust beneficiaries (children or other beneficiaries of the trustmaker (grantor's choice)). The amount of the annuity payment that is required to be paid to the trustmaker (grantor) during the term of the GRAT is calculated by using an interest rate the IRS determines monthly, called the section 7520 rate. 

The trustmaker (grantor) can set the annuity payments so that it will be exactly equal to the section 7520 interest rate, meaning that all of the assets that have been transferred into the GRAT will theoretically be returned to the trustmaker (grantor) in the form of the annuity payments and nothing will be left for distribution to the children or other beneficiaries when the GRAT ends.

The transfer of assets owned by someone into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of someone else would ordinarily be deemed a gift for federal gift tax purposes, but with a GRAT, since theoretically, all of the assets transferred in could come back to the trustmaker (grantor) the value of the gift to the beneficiaries of the GRAT will be at or close to 0. This is called a zeroed-out GRAT. 

The trustmaker (grantor) is really betting on the fact that the assets transferred into the GRAT will appreciate in value above and beyond the section 7520 interest rate. 

The Drawbacks of Using a GRAT

Assets that are expected to appreciate greatly in value above can be transferred into a GRAT and in turn move a significant amount of property down to the beneficiaries of the GRAT when the term ends. 

There are, however, two downsides to using a GRAT:

1. The assets transferred into the GRAT could grow at a rate lower than the section 7520 rate. If this is the case then the trustmaker (grantor) will simply receive back the trust property at its depreciated value and will only be out of the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.

2. The trustmaker (grantor) could die during the term of the GRAT. If this is the case then all of the property transferred into the GRAT would revert back into the estate of the trustmaker (grantor) and be taxable for estate tax purposes and the trustmaker (grantor) will also be out the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.

The Bottom Line

GRATs are not for everyone or just any type of asset. The trustmaker (grantor) must be willing to take a gamble and bet that the property transferred into the GRAT will outperform the section 7520 interest rate that the trustmaker (grantor) will live to see the end of the term of the GRAT and that the trustmaker (grantor) will not need the gifted property later in life to pay for living expenses or long-term care.""""""",https://www.thebalance.com/how-does-the-stock-market-work-3505397

36,37,"""Futures in Stock Market Definition, Example and How to Trade by Jason Fernando. Jason Fernando is a professional investor and writer who enjoys tackling and communicating complex business and financial problems. Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price regardless of the current market price at the expiration date. Underlying assets include physical commodities and financial instruments. Futures contracts detail the quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. Futures can be used for hedging or trade speculation.

Futures, also called futures contracts, allow traders to lock in the price of the underlying asset or commodity. These contracts have expiration dates and set prices that are known upfront. Futures are identified by their expiration month. For example, a December gold futures contract expires in December. Traders and investors use the term futures in reference to the overall asset class. However, there are many types of futures contracts available for trading including Commodity futures with underlying commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, corn and wheat, Stock index futures with underlying assets such as the S&P 500 Index, Currency futures including those for the euro and the British pound, Precious metal futures for gold and silver, U.S. Treasury futures for bonds and other financial securities.

The futures markets typically use high leverage. Leverage means that the trader does not need to put up 100% of the contract's value amount when entering into a trade. Instead, the broker would require an initial margin amount which consists of a fraction of the total contract value. The exchange where the futures contract trades will determine if the contract is for physical delivery or if it can be cash-settled.

A futures contract allows a trader to speculate on the direction of a commodity's price. If a trader bought a futures contract and the price of the commodity rose and was trading above the original contract price at expiration, then they would have a profit. Before expiration, the futures contract, the long position, would be sold at the current price, closing the long position. The difference between the prices would be cash-settled in the investor's brokerage account and no physical product would change hands.

Futures can be used to hedge the price movement of the underlying asset. The goal is to prevent losses from potentially unfavorable price changes rather than to speculate. Many companies that enter hedges are using, or in many cases producing, the underlying asset. For example, corn farmers can use futures to lock in a specific price for selling their corn crop. By doing so, they reduce their risk and guarantee they will receive the fixed price. If the price of corn decreased, the farmer would have a gain on the hedge to offset losses from selling the corn at the market.

The futures markets are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC is a federal agency created by Congress in 1974 to ensure the integrity of futures market pricing, including preventing abusive trading practices, fraud, and regulating brokerage firms engaged in futures trading.

Futures contracts are an investment vehicle that allows the buyer to bet on the futures price of a commodity or other security. There are many types of futures contracts available. These may have underlying assets such as oil, stock market indexes, currencies, and agricultural products. Unlike forward contracts, which are customized between the parties involved, futures contracts trade on organized exchanges such as those operated by the CME Group Inc. Futures contracts are popular among traders who aim to profit on price swings as well as commercial customers who wish to hedge their risks.""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp

Each asset class has different risks and return potential so each will behave differently over time. No simple formula can find the right asset allocation for every individual investor.There's no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors make. Selecting individual securities within an asset class is done only after you decide how to divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. This will largely determine your investment results.Financial advisors generally recommend holding stocks for five years or longer. Cash and money market accounts are appropriate for goals less than a year away. Bonds fall somewhere in between. Financial advisors once recommended subtracting an investor's age from 100 to determine what percentage should be invested in stocks. A 40-year-old would therefore be 60% invested in stocks. Variations of this rule recommend subtracting age from 110 or 120 given that average life expectancy continues to grow.Economic cycles of growth and contraction greatly affect how you should allocate your assets. During bull markets, investors ordinarily prefer growth-oriented assets like stocks to profit from better market conditions. Alternatively, during downturns or recessions, investors tend to shift toward more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents which can help preserve capital.An asset allocation fund provides investors with a diversified portfolio of investments across various asset classes. The asset allocation of the fund can be fixed or variable among a mix of asset classes.Behavioral finance explores how common cognitive errors might influence our financial choices. For our asset allocation, we might be swayed too much by recent market trends, overconfidence, sunk-cost reasoning or loss aversion, which can lead to less beneficial allocation choices.Most financial professionals will tell you that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors can make. The selection of individual securities is secondary to how assets are allocated in stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents, which will play more of a role in your investment results.""""""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp

59,62,"""Behavioral Finance. This is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It also includes the subsequent effect on the markets. It focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases. 

Traditional Financial Theory. In order to better understand behavioral finance, let's first look at traditional financial theory. Traditional finance includes the following beliefs: Both the market and investors are perfectly rational, investors truly care about utilitarian characteristics, investors have perfect self-control, they are not confused by cognitive errors or information processing errors.

Behavioral Finance Theory. Traits of behavioral finance are: Investors are treated as normal, not rational. They actually have limits to their self-control. Investors are influenced by their own biases. Investors make cognitive errors that can lead to wrong decisions.

Decision-Making Errors and Biases. Behavioral finance views investors as normal but being subject to decision-making biases and errors. We can break down the decision-making biases and errors into four buckets: 1) Self-Deception; 2) Heuristic Simplification; 3) Emotion; 4) Social Influence.

Top 10 Biases in Behavioral Finance. Behavioral finance seeks an understanding of the impact of personal biases on investors. Common biases include Overconfidence and illusion of control, Self Attribution Bias, Hindsight Bias, Confirmation Bias, The Narrative Fallacy, Representative Bias, Framing Bias, Anchoring Bias, Loss Aversion, Herding Mentality.

Overcoming Behavioral Finance Issues: There are ways to overcome negative behavioral tendencies in relation to investing. Here are some strategies you can use to guard against biases.

1) Focus on the Process. Establishing logical decision-making processes can help protect you from such errors. Get yourself focused on the process rather than the outcome.
   
2) Prepare, Plan, and Pre-Commit. Behavioral finance teaches us to invest by preparing, by planning, and by making sure we pre-commit.""",https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/behavioral-finance/

62,65,"""Prospect Theory is a psychology theory that describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and uncertainty. It holds that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains. People usually are averse to the possibility of losing, and would rather avoid a loss than take a risk to make an equivalent gain. 

The theory was introduced by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky to describe how humans make decisions when presented with several choices. The theory describes the decision-making process in two phases: the editing phase and the evaluation phase. The editing phase refers to how people characterize the options for choice while the evaluation phase is where people tend to decide based on the potential outcomes and choose the option with a higher utility.

The prospect theory has four main features which include certainty, small probabilities, relative positioning, and loss aversion. Despite being a widely used theory, it has also faced some criticisms, mainly that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about, and for the inadequate framing theory that explains why actors generate the frames they use.""",https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/prospect-theory/

It sets international standards that aim to prevent these illegal activities and the harm they cause to society. The FATF released two substantial amendments to its Standards providing stronger tools on asset recovery and to prevent the abuse of non-profit organisations for terrorist financing. The FATF has finalised new guidance to improve transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons and has updated its Recommendation 25 on legal arrangements. Cyber-enabled fraud is a major transnational organised crime that has grown exponentially in recent years both in volume of frauds reported and their global spread. Such crimes can have a devastating impact on individuals organisations and economies worldwide causing significant financial losses and eroding trust in digital systems. The FATF Recommendations are the basis on which all countries should meet the shared objective of tackling money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation. The private sector plays a vital role in effectively detecting and preventing misuse of the financial system for money laundering, terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.""""""",https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html
69,72,"""Dodd-Frank Act targets financial system sectors that led to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. This act contains provisions over 848 pages to be implemented over several years. The act is made to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers. The act subjected banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies. Critics argue that the regulatory burdens could make U.S. firms less competitive. In 2018, Congress passed a new law that rolled back some of Dodd-Frank's restrictions. The Dodd-Frank act established new government agencies tasked with overseeing various aspects of the financial system. The law was created to prevent a financial crisis similar to the the one in 2007-2008. The Dodd-Frank act also provides for liquidations or restructurings via the Orderly Liquidation Fund. The aim was to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to prop up such firms. The Volcker Rule restricts how banks can invest, limits speculative trading, and eliminates proprietary trading. The act also regulates derivatives and sets up centralized exchanges for swaps trading. Dodd-Frank established the SEC Office of Credit Ratings to ensure meaningful and reliable credit ratings. After Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, he pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank. Accordingly, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act which rolled back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. When Joseph Biden was elected president in 2020, the CFPB focused on rescinding rules from the Trump era.""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp
70,73,"""SolvencyII is the prudential regime for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the EU. It has entered into force in January 2016. SolvencyII sets out requirements applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies in the EU with the aim to ensure the adequate protection of policyholders and beneficiaries. SolvencyII has a risk-based approach that enables to assess the overall solvency of insurance and reinsurance undertakings through quantitative and qualitative measures. 

The SolvencyII regulatory framework is built on a three-pillar structure. Pillar I sets the quantitative requirements i.e. the assets and liabilities valuation and capital requirements. Pillar II sets the qualitative requirements including governance and risk management of the undertakings and the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ORSA. Pillar III sets the supervisory reporting and public disclosure.

The SolvencyII legal provisions are on three levels: Level 1 SolvencyII Directive, Level 2 the Delegated Regulation and Implementing technical standards, and Level 3 Guidelines.

In 2020, EIOPA provided its technical advice to the European Commission. This led to the 2020 review of the regulatory framework for the supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. 

SolvencyII came to life after three generations of EU Directives applicable since the 1970s. The existing regulation needed revision. In 1999, the European Commission presented its paper on The Review of the Overall Financial Position of an Insurance Undertaking. This initiated the discussion among the European institutions, regulators, and supervisors on the modernisation of the prudential framework for the supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings.""",https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/browse/regulation-and-policy/solvency-ii_en

79,82,"""Blockchain vs. Crypto Not What It Seems. Blockchain not bitcoin emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market's performance woes, the new version does the same but swaps in crypto to reflect the ecosystem's spread. By Noelle Acheson Dec 13 2022 at 6:54 p.m. UTC updated Sep 28 2023 at 2:24 p.m. UTC. The blockchain not bitcoin chorus seems to be re-emerging. Bitcoin was an asset with no backing or clear utility the implied argument seemed to go, whereas blockchain, well, that was a technology. Last week Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled 'Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto' in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Over the past few days, the Red Cross talked about ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group announced plans to work on soul bound tokens for digital identity. Blockchain not bitcoin emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market's performance woes, the new version does the same but swaps in crypto to reflect the ecosystem's spread. This does not at all mean that crypto is losing its sparkle or that asset innovation is done. Both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology's evolution. The crypto ecosystem is certainly big enough by now for any number of approaches, and this industry grew on the back of permissionless innovation. It is also an acknowledgement that there is a constant battle for attention, and the X not Y model assumes that only one variable is worthy. Don't underestimate blockchain utility; there's plenty to get excited about. Meanwhile, the narrative shift will act as a refreshing reminder that this industry is about much more than profits and portfolio allocations, and that the potential goes way beyond sentiment recovery, regulatory clarity, and deeper understanding. Blockchain and crypto, there's plenty of room for both.""",https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/13/blockchain-vs-crypto-not-what-it-seems/

81,84,"""Blockchain is a decentralized record-keeping technology that stores data unalterably on a public ledger. It is censorship-proof, immutable, tamper-proof making it completely secure. In a blockchain network, every node works to prevent errors and verify transactions. Blockchain uses blocks that are chained together to store data. The first and most famous usage of blockchain is Bitcoin.

Blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that enables users to transact without any centralized authority. Blockchain technology is beneficial for judiciary banks, logistics companies, the entertainment industry and many other sectors due to its smart contract capabilities, tokenization and immutability.

Blockchain technology one of the best use cases of distributed ledger technology, is essentially a decentralized data-storing digital ledger. When anyone wishes to make a transaction, an entry representing that transaction is created in a block. This block is sent to the node operators in the network. Transaction validation and new block production for PoW networks like Bitcoin, relies on powerful computer hardware.

Each block in the blockchain is created by connecting to the previous block. The transaction in each block is verified with an alphanumeric timestamp called a hash. Each new block features a hash of a previous block in the chain, this inhibits any rearrangement of blocks to prevent data tampering, making data stored on the blockchain completely secure.

Cryptocurrencies are the most common digital assets using blockchain technology. Bitcoin was put forth as a project by an its developer Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

Blockchain technology continues to attract the attention of more industries and companies. Blockchain meaning technology that enables P2P transactions without intermediaries will likely play an ever larger role as social interactions and finance continues shifting online.

Different blockchain networks adopt different consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-Work is a consensus mechanism that requires computing power and energy-intensive use. Proof-of-Stake is an algorithm developed as an alternative to PoW.

Blockchain projects are built around three key features: scalability, decentralization and security. The blockchain trilemma introduced by Ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin, states that crypto networks can only offer two of the three key benefits at any given time with respect to decentralization, security, and scalability.

Blockchain technology brought innovations like Smart Contracts, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and DeFi (Decentralized finance).

As blockchain technology is rapidly increasing use cases around the world. More users, companies, and governments are discovering how blockchain technology can help them and are supporting its further development.""",https://coincodex.com/article/19566/blockchain-101-the-ultimate-guide-for-beginners/

83,86,"""""""A robo-advisor, also sometimes spelled as roboadvisor, is a digital platform that provides automated, algorithm-driven financial planning and investment services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor asks questions about your financial situation and future goals through an online survey. It then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest for you. Other common designations for robo-advisors include automated investment advisor, automated investment management, and digital advice platforms.

The best robo-advisors offer easy account set-up, robust goal planning, account services, and portfolio management. Additionally, they offer security features, comprehensive education, and low fees.

Key Takeaways:

- Robo-advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven investment services with minimal human supervision.
- They often automate and optimize passive indexing strategies based on modern portfolio theory.
- Robo-advisors are often inexpensive and require low opening balances, making them available to retail investors.
- They are best suited for traditional investing and aren't the best options for more complex issues such as estate planning.
- Robo-advisors have been criticized for their lack of empathy and complexity.

The industry has experienced explosive growth. Client assets managed by robo-advisors are expected to reach 3 trillion in 2023 and 5 trillion worldwide by 2027. 

A robo-advisor holds the same legal status as human advisors. Accordingly, they must be registered with the SEC and are subject to the same securities laws and regulations as traditional broker-dealers.

Robo-advisors leverage advances in algorithmic trading and electronic markets to automate investment strategies for ordinary investors. Often based on modern portfolio theory, robo-advisors are able to optimize investors' risk-return trade-offs and automatically manage and rebalance their portfolios.

Automation also allows for tax-loss harvesting and other strategies that were once too complex or expensive for ordinary investors. 

With low fees and small minimum balances required to get started, robo-advisors may be a good choice for most long-term investors and may be especially attractive to younger, tech-forward individuals.""""""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp

An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer algorithms send small portions of the full order to the market over time. Algorithmic trading makes use of complex formulas combined with mathematical models and human oversight to make decisions to buy or sell financial securities on an exchange. Algorithmic traders often make use of high-frequency trading technology which can enable a firm to make tens of thousands of trades per second. Algorithmic trading can be used in a wide variety of situations including order execution, arbitrage, and trend trading strategies. KeyTakeawaysAlgorithmic trading is the use of process-and rules-based algorithms to employ strategies for executing trades. Understanding Algorithmic TradingThe use of algorithms in trading increased after computerized trading systems were introduced in American financial markets during the 1970s.  His book argued that these companies were engaged in an arms race to build ever faster computers which could communicate with exchanges ever more quickly to gain advantage on competitors with speed using order types which benefited them to the detriment of average investors. The practice has been made possible by the spread of high-speed internet and the development of ever-faster computers at relatively cheap prices. Traders are developing algorithms that rely on deep learning to make themselves more profitable.  The speed of order execution an advantage in ordinary circumstances can become a problem when several orders are executed simultaneously without human intervention. The flash crash of 2010 has been blamed on algorithmic trading.  Research has uncovered that algorithmic trading was a major factor in causing a loss of liquidity in currency markets after the Swiss franc discontinued its Europegin in 2015.

Banks are revamping their digital strategies to make better use of technology at their companies. AI and cloud tech are giving some banks an edge over competitors and enticing brand loyalty. Outdated IT systems are hard to modernize but they must be updated to meet current needs. This article is part of Build IT, a series about digital tech and innovation trends that are disrupting industries. In a 2023 Go Banking Rates survey of US consumers, 59% of respondents said they would rather bank with smartphone applications and 22% said they were more inclined to use banking websites. However, online banking is only a small part of the digital transformation underway in the sector as innovations such as AI-driven tools and cloud technology radically re-style the industry. A study from the banking-tech company 10x found that bad customer experience could result in banks losing 20% of their customers. Digital transformation is a must for banks. With online banking now the norm, digital transformation is no longer optional for banks. The next iteration of the internet known as Web3 will likely bring new possibilities to the banking industry. In particular, Web3 technologies such as cryptocurrencies, blockchains, smart contracts and non fungible tokens are introducing a new security standard for financial interactions as customers expect more reassurance in their financial dealings.""""""

92,95,"""Mobile Payments vs. Credit Card Payments. Mobile payments have never been more popular. People are using mobile payments these days to complete quick transactions through their mobile devices. You'll notice a few distinct differences when looking at mobile and credit card payments. Many of these entail the technologies used and how people may find mobile payments to be more useful for their needs. The Concept of a Mobile Payment: A mobile payment entails a transaction made through a mobile device. The user will pay for something with a mobile payment solution like Apple Pay or Google Pay. The system incorporates credit card or bank data in one platform. The user will transmit one's payment information from that account to the retailer to complete the purchase. 

A Safer Solution: One difference between mobile payments and credit card deals is that mobile transactions are safer. A mobile payment can help the customer send data from a digital wallet to the retailer completing the transaction without providing any cards. The mobile payment system ensures full security over a deal. You won't see that same security with a credit card. Although credit cards have evolved to feature a chip-based system that is harder to hack there is always the potential for someone to steal a card. A person can always steal a card or its identifying numbers and use it to commit fraud.

Convenience For the Customer: Customers also use mobile transactions because they are more convenient There's no need for the customer to keep lots of cards on hand. The customer's payment info is all on the same mobile payment app. It takes less time to complete a mobile payment than it does to run a credit card. It is easier to track a phone or other smart device if it gets lost than if one's credit card was lost. 

Will Mobile Payments Take Over: It is possible that mobile payments will become more popular than credit cards after a while. It will take a long time before anyone can figure out what will happen. The problem with mobile payments is that many people are uncertain about how they work. They also might not have the mobile devices necessary to complete these payments.
