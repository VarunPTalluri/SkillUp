0,0,0,"""Economic Indicator Definition and How to Interpret by Adam Barone. An economic indicator is a piece of economic data, usually of macroeconomic scale, that is used by analysts to interpret current or future investment possibilities. These indicators also help to judge the overall health of an economy. Economic indicators can be anything the investor chooses, but specific pieces of data released by the government and non-profit organizations have become widely followed. Such indicators include but are not limited to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP), or unemployment figures.

Types of Economic Indicators. Economic indicators can be divided into categories or groups. Most of these economic indicators have a specific schedule for release, allowing investors to prepare for and plan on seeing certain information at certain times of the month and year.

Leading Indicators. Leading indicators such as the yield curve, consumer durables, net business formations, and share prices are used to predict the future movements of an economy. These indicators must be taken with a grain of salt as they can be incorrect.

Coincident Indicators. Coincident indicators, which include things such as GDP, employment levels, and retail sales, are seen with the occurrence of specific economic activities. This class of metrics shows the activity of a particular area or region.

Lagging Indicators. Lagging indicators, such as gross national product (GNP), CPI, unemployment rates, and interest rates, are only seen after a specific economic activity occurs. These indicators show information after the event has happened.

Interpreting Economic Indicators. An economic indicator is only useful if one interprets it correctly. Economic indicators hold tremendous value when compared across a period of time. Many economic indicators have a benchmark set, allowing analysts to gauge a statistic.

The Stock Market As an Indicator. One of the top leading indicators is the stock market itself.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Economic Indicators. Pros of Economic Indicators. Economic indicators rely on data to substantiate predictions of what is to come in the future. When analyzed correctly, investors can capitalize on data to make successful trades or correctly assess future market conditions.

Cons of Economic Indicators. The obvious downside to economic indicators is that they rely on some degree of forecasting. Therefore, economic indicators do not always predict the future correctly.

The Bottom Line. Economic indicators are leading, coincident, or lagging figures that indicate broad conditions. Economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, or certain prices inform economics, companies, and investors of not only where the economy is today, but perhaps where the economy may be headed. Economic indicators can be used to guide government policy or set investment strategies.""","The article ""Economic Indicator Definition and How to Interpret"" by Adam Barone, explains that economic indicators are pieces of macroeconomic data used by analysts to interpret potential investment opportunities and to analyze the overall health of an economy. Popular indicators include the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and unemployment figures. The indicators can be categorized into three groups: leading, coincident, and lagging. Leading indicators like consumer durables and share prices help predict future economic trends, but their predictions aren't always accurate. Coincident indicators like GDP, employment levels, and retail sales reflect current economic activities. Lagging indicators like the GNP, CPI, unemployment rates, and interest rates provide information about past economic activities. The accuracy of these indicators relies on correct interpretation and comparison over time. Despite offering valuable insights, they posses the risk of delivering incorrect future predictions. The article ascertains the stock market as one of the crucial leading indicators and discusses the role of indicators as policy or investment guiding tool for governments and investors respectively.

1,1,1,"""Economic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Metrics such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and written reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. Policymakers use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going but how fast it's getting there. Information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and asset allocation. The various government and nonprofit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, which can be very useful to individual investors. Indicators are able to give investors a better understanding of various economic conditions. There are also indexes for coincident indicators and lagging indicators, these are based on whether they tend to rise during or after an economic expansion. Several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. Overall, asset allocation decisions can fluctuate over time and making such changes after a monthly review of macro indicators may be wise. Investors can better understand the stock market and the economy in which their dollars are invested, and they can also be better prepared to revisit an investment thesis when the timing is right. Using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter portfolio management.""","The text discusses the importance of economic indicators as crucial instruments for investors. These tools, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and reports such as the Beige Book, provide vital information about the current status and potential trajectories of the economy. They are valuable for making decisions related to investments and asset allocation, as they provide broad nationwide coverage and often detailed industry breakdowns. Indicators can enhance an investor's comprehension of various economic conditions and their applications can range from supporting real-time decisions to those based on trends over time. The information may be used in combination with other reports for comprehensive decision-making. Regular review of these macro indicators is recommended for effective asset allocation. The combined use of economic indicator data and standard asset and securities analysis can facilitate intelligent portfolio management.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/economic_indicators.asp

What Are Financial Markets? Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs, including the stock market, bond market, forex market, and derivatives market. Key Takeaways: Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs. There are many kinds of financial markets, including but not limited to forex, money, stock, and bond markets. These markets may include assets or securities that are either listed on regulated exchanges or trade over-the-counter (OTC). Financial markets trade in all types of securities and are critical to the smooth operation of a capitalist society. When financial markets fail, economic disruption, including recession and rising unemployment, can result. Understanding the Financial Markets: Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of capitalist economies by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs. The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings. Financial markets create securities products that provide a return for those with excess funds (investors/lenders) and make these funds available to those needing additional money (borrowers). The stock market is just one type of financial market. Financial markets are created when people buy and sell financial instruments including equities, bonds, currencies, and derivatives. Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate. Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value. Types of Financial Markets: There are several different types of markets. Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it. Stock Markets: Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets. These are venues where companies list their shares which are bought and sold by traders and investors. Typical participants in a stock market include both retail and institutional investors, traders, market makers (MMs)and specialists who maintain liquidity and provide two-sided markets. Brokers are third parties that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers but who do not take an actual position in a stock. Over-the-Counter Markets: An over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market, meaning it does not have physical locations and trading is conducted electronically in which market participants trade securities directly, meaning without a broker. Bond Markets: A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate. Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Money Markets: Typically, the money markets trade in product with highly liquid short-term maturities(less than one year) and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets. Derivatives Markets: A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset, like a security, or set of assets, like an index. Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded. Options markets, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) similarly list and regulate options contracts. Forex Market: The forex (foreign exchange) market is where participants can buy, sell, hedge, and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs. Commodities Markets: Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as agricultural products, energy products, precious metals, or soft commodities. Cryptocurrency Markets: Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online crypto exchanges. Examples of Financial Markets: The above sections make clear that the financial markets are broad in scope and scale. The Bottom Line: Financial markets provide liquidity, capital, and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability. Without financial markets, capital could not be allocated efficiently, and economic activity such as commerce and trade, investments, and growth opportunities would be greatly diminished.""","The article emphasizes the crucial role of financial markets in the economy. It explains that financial markets consist of realms like the stock, bond, forex, and derivatives markets where the trading of securities occurs. Financial markets' key functions include resource allocation and liquidity creation for businesses and entrepreneurs by offering a platform for buyers and sellers. Also, financial markets facilitate the creation of securities products that provide returns to investors and avail funds to borrowers. The article discusses various types of financial markets such as stock markets, over-the-counter markets, bond markets, money markets, derivatives markets, forex market, commodities markets, and cryptocurrency markets. It concludes by underlining that financial markets are essential for economic growth and stability, as they provide liquidity, capital, and participation, facilitating efficient allocation of capital and supporting economic activities like commerce, trade, and investment.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp

5,5,5,"""""""The 50-30-20 Budget Rule Explained With Examples. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren popularized the 50-20-30 budget rule in her book All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan. The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50 on needs, 30 on wants, and 20 on savings. This intuitive and straightforward rule can help you draw up a reasonable budget that you can stick to overtime in order to meet your financial goals. Key Takeaways: The rule states that you should spend up to 50% of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do. The remaining half should be split up between 20% savings and debt repayment and 30% to everything else that you might want. The rule is a template that is intended to help individuals manage their money and save for emergencies and retirement. The purpose of the 50-30-20 rule is to balance paying for necessities while being mindful of long-term savings and retirement. The 50-30-20 rule can be simplified by setting up automatic deposits using automatic payments and tracking changes in income.

The 50-30-20 rule can guide individuals to financial prosperity in several ways. Potential benefits from these guidelines include ease of use, financial balance, prioritizing vital expenses, emphasize saving goals, and promote long-term financial security. To adopt the 50-30-20 budget rule, track your expenses, understand your income, identify your critical costs, automate your savings, and maintain consistency.

Example of the 50-30-20 Budget Rule: Imagine a person recently graduated from college and started her first full-time job. She wants to develop good financial habits from the beginning and has heard about the 50-30-20 budget rule. Eager to take control of her finances, she decides to set up a 50-30-20 budget. To understand her spending patterns, the person starts tracking her expenses for a month. In the long run, the person has taken steps to not only have their needs met but have sufficient funds available for their future.

Saving is difficult and life often throws unexpected expenses at us. By following the 50-20-30 rule, individuals have a plan with how they should manage their after-tax income. If they find that their expenditures on wants are more than 30%, they can find ways to reduce those expenses that will help direct funds to more important areas such as emergency money and retirement. Life should be enjoyed and it is not recommended to live like a Spartan, but having a plan and sticking to it will allow you to cover your expenses, save for retirement all at the same time doing the activities that make you happy.""""""","The article explains the 50-30-20 budget rule, popularized by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, as a personal finance strategy to balance spending and saving. According to the rule, after-tax income should be divided into needs (50%), wants (30%), and savings (20%). The rule provides an accessible method to manage money, save for emergencies and future needs like retirement, and balance necessary expenses with discretionary spending. Benefits include financial security, emphasis on savings, and prioritization of critical costs. To adopt this rule, individuals can track expenses, understand income, identify important costs, set up automated savings, and maintain consistent efforts. An example provided illustrates a recent graduate using the rule to manage her finances effectively. The key takeaway is the necessity for a well-defined plan for income management, ensuring savings for future requirements while enjoying life. The rule serves as a useful guideline to cut excessive spending and direct funds towards more important areas.

An ideal emergency fund should contain three to six months' worth of expenses and be held in accounts that are easily accessible and liquidated. Methods of building such a fund include setting aside a regular comfortable amount from one's salary monthly, saving tax refunds, and utilizing employer programs encouraging emergency savings. The text cautions that it may be challenging to establish an emergency fund for those living paycheck to paycheck, encouraging them to set achievable saving goals. Besides, it provides an example of how much an individual or couple needs to save in their emergency fund based on monthly expenses.

8,8,8,"""Our Guide to Investing for Beginners. If you've decided to start investing, congratulations! By setting aside some of your money now in investments that could appreciate over time, you'll set yourself up for greater financial security in the future. Now that you've decided that you want to invest, it's important to devote some time to learning how to invest. Here are some basic concepts you should know before you get started. 

Why should I invest? The easy answer to the question is to create wealth. Investing can help you reach your financial goals such as paying for your children's college education, passing wealth to loved ones, or building a nest egg for your own retirement. 

There are hundreds of things you can invest in ranging from stocks and bonds to artwork and collectible coins. Stocks, also known as equities, represent partial ownership of one or more companies. If a company does well, the stock can increase in value. Stocks have high return potential over long time periods but tend to be more volatile than other investments. 

Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds pool money from many investors and then invest it in an assortment of stocks, bonds or other investments. For example, an S&P 500 ETF would invest in all 500 stocks that make up the index.

Determining the appropriate asset allocation for your investment strategy is a critical step to take. There are two main methods of investing. Active investment refers to picking individual stocks and bonds or buying mutual funds that are actively managed by professionals. On the other hand, passive investing means simply trying to match the market's performance, generally through funds that track indexes. 

If you choose to invest in individual stocks, the first thing you should understand is the difference between investing and speculating. Investing is a long-term activity designed to achieve sustained returns that can compound over time. Speculating is akin to gambling, trying to chase a quick payday. 

Once you've learned the basics and you've come up with your game plan, the next step is to open a brokerage account and put your plan into action. Be sure to shop around as different brokerages charge different fees and offer different features. As a new investor, you'll want a brokerage which offers access to investment research and educational features in order to help with stock selection and to answer any questions you might have along the way.""","The article is an introductory guide to investing, targeted at individuals who have decided to invest money to improve their financial security. Investing, it says, can help individuals reach their financial goals such as funding their children's college education, transferring wealth to loved ones, or saving for their own retirement.

It briefly describes mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which combine funds from various investors into diversified portfolios. The importance of determining an appropriate asset allocation is also highlighted. The article distinguishes between active and passive investment strategies. It also differentiates investing, considered a long-term activity with sustained returns, from speculating, compared to gambling for quick paybacks. The guide advises individuals to open a brokerage account and choose one that provides features beneficial to their need, such as research and education about investments.",https://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/08/19/our-guide-to-investing-for-beginners.aspx
9,9,9,"""""""Risk. All investments carry some degree of risk. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds can lose value, even their entire value, if market conditions sour. Even conservative insured investments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a bank or credit union come with inflation risk. That is, they may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.

What Is Risk? When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to negatively impact your financial welfare. For example, your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions (market risk). Corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company, can affect the value of your investments (business risk). 

There are other types of risk. How easy or hard it is to cash out of an investment when you need to is called liquidity risk. Another risk factor is tied to how many or how few investments you hold. Generally speaking, the more financial eggs you have in one basket, say all your money in a single stock, the greater risk you take (concentration risk). In short, risk is the possibility that a negative financial outcome that matters to you might occur.

Risk and Reward. The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class typically correlates with the level of return the investment might achieve. The rationale behind this relationship is that investors willing to take on risky investments and potentially lose money should be rewarded for their risk. Historically, stocks have enjoyed the most robust average annual returns over the long term, followed by corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, and cash equivalents.

Time Can Be Your Friend or Foe. Based on historical data, holding a portfolio of stocks over an extended period of time significantly reduces your chances of losing your principal. However, the historical data should not mislead investors into thinking that there is no risk in investing in stocks over a long period of time.

Managing Risk. You cannot eliminate investment risk. But two basic investment strategies, asset allocation and diversification, can help manage both systemic risk and non-systemic risk. Hedging and insurance products can provide additional ways to manage risk. However, both strategies typically involve higher risk activity, such as short selling, trading in complex products such as options, or investing in illiquid securities.

The bottom line is that all investments carry some degree of risk. By better understanding the nature of risk and taking steps to manage those risks, you put yourself in a better position to meet your financial goals.""""""","The text discusses the associated risks and potential rewards in investment. It explains that all investments, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and even conservative ones like certificates of deposit, carry some degree of risk due to market fluctuations, inflation, business decisions, and liquidity issues. Concentration risk, the danger that stems from putting all your money in a single investment, is also highlighted. The text mentions that while risk is associated with every investment, there is usually a higher potential return on riskier assets. The importance of time in investment is noted, stressing that while long-term investment in stocks reduces the chance of losing principal, investors should not dismiss the possible risks. It also advocates for managing risk through strategies like asset allocation, diversification, hedging, and insurance products. The article suggests that understanding and managing risk can position investors to achieve their financial goals efficiently.",https://www.finra.org/investors/investing/investing-basics/risk

IRAs: Understanding IRAs. What is an IRA? Pick investments for your IRA. Roth vs. traditional IRAs. 401k vs. IRA: IRA Roth Conversion. How to convert to a Roth IRA online.

If your employer offers a retirement plan like a 401k or 403b and will match a percentage of your contributions, you should definitely take advantage of it; after all, it's free money for you. Plus, you'll have a tax-deferred account that makes saving a cinch through automatic payroll deduction. 

If your employer doesn't offer a plan, then an IRA can be a good start to your retirement savings and another opportunity for your earnings to grow tax-free. 

401k vs. IRA: Who can participate: Anyone who works for an employer that offers a plan. Effective for 2020 contributions and later, anyone with earned income can open and contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. 

How much you can invest: If you're under age 50, your annual contribution limit is 20500 for 2022 and 22500 for 2023. If you're age 50 or older, your annual contribution limit is 27000 for 2022 and 30000 for 2023. If you're under age 50, your annual contribution limit is 6000 for 2022 and 6500 for 2023. If you're age 50 or older, your annual contribution limit is 7000 for 2022 and 7500 for 2023. 

What you can invest in: Most employers limit you to a preselected list of investment choices. You can invest in a wide variety of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and individual stocks and bonds. 

How to get started: Your employer may automatically enroll you in the plan and offer you an easy way to contribute through automatic payroll deduction. You can open an IRA on your own through almost any bank, brokerage company, insurance firm or investment company.

Eligible for both a 401k and an IRA? Go for it! The good news is that you don't necessarily have to think IRA versus 401k. You can save with both as long as you're qualified and heed contribution and income limits. 

Contribute to your company's 401k and contribute at least the amount that your employer will match. Contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA. Go back to your 401k plan and contribute beyond the match to the annual maximum allowed if possible.

All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. When taking withdrawals from an IRA before age 59, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax.""""""
","The article from Vanguard discusses how saving in both a 401k and an IRA can positively impact one's financial comfort in retirement. If an employer offers a retirement plan (like a 401k or 403b) and will match a percentage of contributions, it is beneficial to participate as it offers tax-deferred savings and automatic payroll deduction. In absence of an employer-based plan, an IRA can provide a tax-free earnings growth avenue for retirement savings. Contribution limits vary based on age and the type of savings plan. Most employers offer a pre-selected investment list, however, an IRA can diversify your portfolio with options like mutual funds, ETFs, and individual stocks and bonds. One doesn't have to choose between an IRA and a 401k. As long as one qualifies and respects the contribution and income limits, saving with both can have long-term financial benefits. Investing is subject to risk, and diversification doesn't guarantee a profit, but it could help protect against losses. Early withdrawals from an IRA may be subject to additional taxes and penalties.",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/iras/401k-vs-ira

Market structure in economics refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for goods and services. It is based on the characteristics that influence the behavior and outcomes of companies working in a specific market. Some of the factors that determine a market structure include the number of buyers and sellers, ability to negotiate, degree of concentration, degree of differentiation of products, and the ease or difficulty of entering and exiting the market. 

Market structure refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods. The four popular types of market structures include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition. Market structures show the relations between sellers and other sellers, sellers to buyers or more.

Understanding Market Structures: In economics, market structures can be understood well by closely examining an array of factors or features exhibited by different players. 

Types of Market Structures: 1. Perfect CompetitionA perfect competition occurs when there is a large number of small companies competing against each other. They sell similar products (homogeneous), lack price influence over the commodities, and are free to enter or exit the market.

2. Monopolistic Competition: Monopolistic competition refers to an imperfectly competitive market with the traits of both the monopoly and competitive market. Sellers compete among themselves and can differentiate their goods in terms of quality and branding to look different.

3. Oligopoly An oligopoly market consists of a small number of large companies that sell differentiated or identical products. Since there are few players in the market, their competitive strategies are dependent on each other.

4. Monopoly: In a monopoly market, a single company represents the whole industry.

16,16,16,"""""""Corporate Finance Fundamentals Optimal Capital Structure by Dorothy Macasasa. Today I am re-summarizing some of the key points I've learned from CFI Corporate Finance Fundamental course I took. Let's begin. 

Optimal Capital Structure: a company's different sources of financing such as debt equity and other financial instruments that allow the company to minimize its overall cost of capital and maximize shareholder value. The optimal capital structure of a firm is often defined as the proportion of debt and equity that results to the lowest weighted average cost of debt and equity (WACC) of the firm.

As an indicator, if the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is lower than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), then it is advisable to either repurchase shares or pay cash dividends as it indicates that the company's projects or investments are not generating returns that exceed the cost of capital.

WACC Formula: Cost of Equity (the rate of return a shareholder requires for investing equity into business) + Cost of Debt (the rate of return a lender requires given the risk of the business).

Terminologies:
Debt: Capital raised by borrowing money from various sources such as banks, bondholders or other financial institutions.
Equity: Capital funds raised by issuing shares of ownership in the company to investors. 

The optimal capital structure relies on equity versus debt decision. HAVING TOO MUCH DEBT may increase the risk of default in repayment while DEPENDING TOO HEAVENLY ON EQUITY may dilute earnings and value for investors.

Factors to consider when determining the optimal capital structure:
1. Cost of Capital
2. Risk Tolerance
3. Industry and Business Characteristics
4. Flexibility and Growth
5. Market Conditions
6. Debt Covenants and Restrictions

","The article, ""Corporate Finance Fundamentals Optimal Capital Structure"" by Dorothy Macasasa, discusses the concept of optimal capital structure. This concept refers to a firm's mix of financing - debt, equity, and other financial instruments - that helps minimize its overall cost of capital while maximizing shareholder value. The optimal blend of debt and equity results in the lowest weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The article states that when a firm's internal rate of return (IRR) is less than its WACC, repurchasing shares or paying dividends is suggested, as it implies that the firm's projects or investments aren't generating sufficient returns. Terminologies like debt (capital raised by borrowing) and equity (capital raised by issuing company ownership shares) are elaborated. The article stresses the balance between debt and equity; too much debt increases default risk, while over-reliance on equity can dilute earnings and value for investors. Factors such as cost of capital, risk tolerance, industry and business characteristics, flexibility and growth, market conditions, and debt covenants and restrictions must be considered when determining optimal capital structure.",https://medium.com/@dorothymacasasa/corporate-finance-fundamentals-optimal-capital-structure-f77ee6cc23f3

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy: This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers.

Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy: In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. A company will use branding, advertising and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products. Companies will have control over their own prices. 

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy: Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. A company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services.

Monopoly Market Structure: The pricing strategy here is simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. Monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and therefore attract competitors or change consumer behavior in favor of substitute products.

Question: In monopolistic competitive markets, firms: A) are price takers, B) react to the prices set by competitors or C) set their own prices. 

Solution: The correct answer is C. In monopolistic competition, a firm won't be affected by another firm's strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.""""""","The article discusses different pricing strategies according to various market structures.

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy: This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand, the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices.

Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can successfully set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. Since there are many producers, this will not affect the market as a whole. A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products. Also, since there are many competitors, a firm won't be affected by another firm's strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices. Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy: Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars. Generally, an optimal pricing strategy in the long run incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors. Monopoly Market Structure: The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits if you may in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand. Question: In monopolistic competitive markets, firms A.are price takers B.react to the prices set by competitors or C.set their own prices. Solution: The correct answer is C. In monopolistic competition, a firm won't be affected by another firm's strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.""","The article discusses different pricing strategies used by firms in various market structures: Perfect Competition, Monopolistic Competition, Oligopolistic Competition, and Monopoly. In a Perfect Competition, firms are price-takers, meaning that prices are influenced by supply and demand curves. Firms simply provide what consumers are willing and able to buy at given market prices. In a Monopolistically Competitive market, companies have the ability to set their own prices. This pricing is often influenced by things like branding, advertising, and packaging in order to differentiate one company's product from another. In contrast, in an Oligopolistic market, prices are more interdependent; this means that firms must consider the actions of their few competitors when setting prices. Finally, in a Monopoly, firms have the freedom to set prices without competition, but must be mindful not to price too high, which could lead to changes in consumer behavior or encourage potential competition. The article concludes by answering a topic-related question, confirming that in a Monopolistic Competition firms indeed set their own prices.",https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/economics/describe-pricing-strategy-under-each-market-structure/

Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets

Financial Statement Scorecard. There are millions of individual investors worldwide, and while a large percentage of these investors have chosen mutual funds as the vehicle of choice for their investing activities, many others are also investing directly in stocks. Prudent investing practices dictate that we seek out quality companies with strong balance sheets, solid earnings, and positive cash flows. 

Financial Statements to Use: The financial statements used in investment analysis are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement with additional analysis of a company's shareholder's equity and retained earnings. Although the income statement and the balance sheet typically receive the majority of the attention from investors and analysts, it's important to include in your analysis the often overlooked cash flow statement.

Diversity of Reporting: Don't expect financial statements to fit into a single mold. Many articles and books on financial statement analysis take a one-size-fits-all approach. 

Understanding Financial Jargon: The lack of any appreciable standardization of financial reporting terminology complicates the understanding of many financial statement account entries.

Accounting Art Not Science: The presentation of a company's financial position, as portrayed in its financial statements, is influenced by management's estimates and judgments. 

Key Accounting Conventions: Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are used to prepare financial statements.

Non-Financial Information: Information on the state of the economy, the industry, competitive considerations, market forces, technological change, the quality of management, and the workforce are not directly reflected in a company's financial statements. 

Financial Ratios and Indicators: The absolute numbers in financial statements are of little value for investment analysis unless these numbers are transformed into meaningful relationships to judge a company's financial performance and gauge its financial health.

Notes to Financial Statements: The financial statement numbers don't provide all of the disclosure required by regulatory authorities. Analysts and investors alike universally agree that a thorough understanding of the notes to financial statements is essential to properly evaluate a company's financial condition and performance.

The Annual Report 10-K: Prudent investors should only consider investing in companies with audited financial statements, which are a requirement for all publicly-traded companies.

Consolidated Statements: Typically, the word 'consolidated' appears in the title of a financial statement as in a consolidated balance sheet. A consolidation of a parent company and its majority-owned subsidiaries means that the combined activities of separate legal entities are expressed as one economic unit.

Why are Financial Statements Important: Financial statements provide investors with information about a company's financial position, helping to ensure corporate transparency and accountability.

Key Financial Statements When Analyzing a Company: Investors should start by learning how to interpret key figures on a company's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. 

Differences Between GAAP and IFRS Accounting Conventions: GAAP sets accounting guidelines and standards that companies must follow when preparing financial statements, whereas IFRS takes a more principles-based approach.

Key Limitations of Using Financial Statements: Financial statements only provide a snapshot of a company's financial situation at a specific point in time. They also don't consider non-financial information such as the health of the broader economy and other factors such as income inequality or environmental sustainability.

The Bottom Line: Understanding the basics of financial statements provides investors with valuable information about a company's financial health. Investors can use key reports such as a balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement to evaluate a company's performance, helping to make more informed investment decisions. However, it's also important to understand the limitations of overly relying on financial statements and consider other metrics such as the impact of non-financial information when analyzing a company's overall financial position. Financial statements play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the financial system and promoting trust between companies and investors.""","The article ""12 Things You Need to Know About Financial Statements"" educates individual investors on critical aspects of financial statements, emphasizing their importance in making informed investment decisions. It reiterates that crucial financial statements include the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, alongside shareholder's equity and retained earnings analysis. The article warns investors not to overlook the cash flow statement, which often lacks attention, and addresses disparities in financial reporting terminology. Furthermore, it recognizes that financial reports reflect management decisions and judgments and are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Additionally, the piece underscores the importance of factors not reflected in financial statements, such as economic conditions, market forces, and quality of management. It highlights that mere numbers in financial statements bear little significance unless interpreted into meaningful financial ratios or indicators for comprehensive company analysis. The article also accents the significance of understanding the notes to financial statements, audited financial statements availability, and the idea of consolidated statements. Lastly, the work acknowledges the limitations of financial statements, including their inability to address non-financial info like income inequality and environmental sustainability.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/financialreporting.asp

text provided by The Motley Fool focuses on explaining how to understand financial statements using Chipotle as a real-life case study. The article is essentially an excerpt from a podcast where senior analyst John Rotonti delves into the details of three primary financial statements: balance sheet, income statement, and the cash flow statement. 

Rotonti takes the reader through an understanding of the principles that govern a balance sheet, illustrating with Chipotle’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. He further expounds on the concept of liquidity and how it characterizes different assets and liabilities listed on the balance sheet. 

Subsequently, Rotonti explains the income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement. He uses a burrito sale at Chipotle to elucidate revenue generation, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and the resulting gross profit margin, highlighting how pricing power can influence this margin over time. 

Along with these explanations, the article also touches on the actual role investors play when purchasing a stock, and it mentions Motley Fool’s own recommendations and resources.

It helps in capital budgeting, with a positive NPV indicating a desirable investment likely to generate excess cash, while a negative NPV suggests a possible loss, warranting investment termination. NPV is calculated by subtracting outbound cash flows from inbound ones, often using a discounted cash flow methodology and a discount rate based on the business's cost of capital. However, if the proposed investment is considered risky, the discount rate may increase, reducing the NPV. The primary benefit of NPV is its simplicity, compressing project cash flows into a single numerical value for comparison with other proposals. Despite this virtue, NPV has several drawbacks, including unreliable cash flow estimates, the use of potentially inappropriate discount rates, vague risk adjustments, and a narrow focus on specific investments.

24,24,24,"""5 Methods for Capital Budgeting. Capital budgeting is defined as the process used to determine whether capital assets are worth investing in. Capital assets are generally only a small portion of a company's total assets, but they are usually long-term investments like new equipment, facilities, and software upgrades. By incorporating strategically planned capital budgeting into their financial processes, companies can more effectively determine and prioritize which projects, programs, and other investment assets could be most financially beneficial in the long term. 

Five primary methods of capital budgeting: 

1. Internal Rate of Return: Used to determine whether a particular investment is worthwhile by assessing the interest that should be yielded over the course of a capital investment.

2. Net Present Value: Used for analyzing the projected returns for a potential investment or project.

3. Profitability Index: Designed to identify the relationship between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was successful.

4. Accounting Rate of Return: The projected return that an organization can expect from a proposed capital investment.

5. Payback Period: A financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been invested.

Each method mentioned has its limitations such as not accounting for the time value of money, risk factors, financing concerns, or the opportunity cost of an investment. Therefore, using the methods in combination with one another is far more reliable. It's important that firms remain mindful of their cash flows and capital assets to ensure that their investments prove profitable in the long term.""

Combining accounting, finance, and business metrics, a financial model is typically a spreadsheet, most often built using Microsoft Excel. It relies on a company's historical performance combined with assumptions about the future to prepare an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, among other supporting schedules. 

Advanced models, like discounted cash flow analysis, leverage buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, and sensitivity analysis, can also be built based on a company's needs. Financial models are used for various decisions, including raising capital, making acquisitions, organic business growth, selling or divesting assets, budgeting, and more. 

Financial modeling requires a solid understanding of accounting fundamentals to understand and calculate the various accounts and their connections. It is usually carried out by professionals in various financial fields, such as investment banking, equity research, and account management. The best way to learn financial modeling is through practice and professional training courses. This helps build a comprehensive understanding of the financial concepts and skills involved in the process.

Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. Put simply, it is the process of monitoring and dealing with the financial risks associated with investing. Risk management essentially occurs when an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment, such as a moral hazard, and then takes the appropriate action or inaction to meet their objectives and risk tolerance.


Risk management is the process of identification, analysis, and acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decisions. Risk is inseparable from return in the investment world. Risk management strategies include avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction.


Investment risk is the deviation from an expected outcome. This deviation is expressed in absolute terms or relative to something else, like a market benchmark. Investment professionals generally accept the idea that the deviation implies some degree of the intended outcome for your investments, whether positive or negative.


Risk management involves identifying and analyzing where risk exists and making decisions about how to deal with it. It occurs everywhere in the realm of finance.


Risk Management Techniques include avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction. One of the tactics to ascertain risk is standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of dispersion around a central tendency.


In behavioral finance, investors exhibit loss aversion. They noted that investors put roughly twice the weight on the pain associated with a loss than the good feeling associated with a profit.


Beta and Passive risk measure oriented to behavioral tendencies is a drawdown, which refers to any period during which an asset's return is negative relative to a previous high mark. In measuring drawdown, we attempt to address three things: The magnitude of each negative period (how bad), The duration of each (how long), The frequency (how often).



Alpha and Active risk refer to the degree that the results of their bets will prove negative rather than positive.


Why Is Risk Management Important? Risk management is a key part of the investment and financial world. It requires investors and fund managers to identify, analyze, and make important decisions about the uncertainty that comes with reaching their goals.


Operational risk is any risk associated with the day-to-day operations of a business. Companies can manage it by identifying and assessing potential risks, measuring them, and putting controls in place to either mitigate or eliminate them altogether.


Risk is an important part of the financial world. The word often brings up feelings of negativity since there is the potential for capital and investment loss. But risk isn't always bad because investments that have more risk often come with the biggest rewards.""""""
","The article discusses the concept of risk management in finance, underlining its essential role in investment decisions. Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and either accepting or reducing uncertainty associated with potential financial losses in investments. It utilizes various strategies, including avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction. The process applies ubiquitously within the finance realm, employing techniques like standard deviation for risk assessment. Concerning behavioral finance, two types of risk measures are discussed: beta and passive risk (oriented to loss aversion behaviors) and alpha and active risk (involved with the potential for negative investment outcomes). The article emphasizes that effective risk management is critical in managing operational risks in businesses and achieving investment goals. Despite the negative connotation often associated with risk, it's an integral part of the financial world, bringing potential for significant rewards alongside possible losses.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp

30,30,30,"""""""What Is a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)? A grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) is a special type of irrevocable trust that allows the trustmaker grantor to gamble against the odds. If the trustmaker grantor plays his cards right then a significant amount of wealth can move down to the next generation with virtually no estate or gift tax ramifications. Here is a general overview of how a GRAT works:

The trustmaker grantor transfers specific assets into the name of the GRAT and as the name suggests, retains the right to receive an annual annuity payment for a certain number of years. When the term of the GRAT ends, what is left in the GRAT is distributed to the trust beneficiaries (children or other beneficiaries of the trustmaker grantor's choice). The amount of the annuity payment that is required to be paid to the trustmaker grantor during the term of the GRAT is calculated by using an interest rate the IRS determines monthly called the section 7520 rate.

The trustmaker grantor is really betting on the fact that the assets transferred into the GRAT will appreciate in value above and beyond the section 7520 interest rate. So while the trustmaker grantor will receive the annuity payments, the beneficiaries of the GRAT will receive the underlying GRAT assets at their value.

Drawbacks of Using a GRAT:
There are however, two downsides to using a GRAT:
1. The assets transferred into the GRAT could grow at a rate lower than the section 7520 rate. If this is the case then the trustmaker grantor will simply receive back the trust property at its depreciated value and will only be out of the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.
2. The trustmaker grantor could die during the term of the GRAT. If this is the case then all of the property transferred into the GRAT would revert back into the estate of the trustmaker grantor and be taxable for estate tax purposes and the trustmaker grantor will also be out the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.

GRATs are not for everyone or just any type of asset. The trustmaker grantor must be willing to take a gamble and bet that the property transferred into the GRAT will outperform the section 7520 interest rate and that the trustmaker grantor will not need the gifted property later in life to pay for living expenses or long-term care.""""""","The article explains a grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT), an irrevocable trust that allows the trustmaker to potentially pass a significant amount of wealth to the next generation with minimum estate or gift tax consequences. In a GRAT, the grantor moves specific assets into the trust and retains the right to receive an annuity payment for a fixed period. When the term ends, any remaining assets in the GRAT go to the chosen beneficiaries. The annuity payment is calculated by an IRS-determined interest rate called the section 7520 rate. If the assets in the trust appreciate beyond this rate, the beneficiaries receive those assets at their appreciated value. However, there are risks - if the assets don't outperform the section 7520 rate, the grantor only gets the depreciated value back and loses the legal fees paid to establish the GRAT. Moreover, if the grantor dies during the GRAT term, the transferred property reverts to the grantor's estate and becomes taxable, in addition to the loss of the legal fees. GRATs involve a degree of risk and are not suitable for everyone or every kind of asset.",https://www.thebalance.com/how-does-the-stock-market-work-3505397

in stock market trading, a type of derivative financial agreement which obligates parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The writer, Jason Fernando, and experts Chip Stapleton and Pete Rathburn explain the purpose, functionality, pros and cons, as well as the uses of futures. Futures contracts are valuable in both speculation and hedging scenarios. When used in a speculative capacity, a futures contract allows a trader to predict the direction of a commodity’s price and potentially gain profit if their prediction is accurate. In hedging, futures contracts are useful tools to mitigate the risk of unfavorable price changes and lock in specific selling or buying prices. The article notes that futures contracts are traded on futures exchanges and are highly leveraged, meaning there's potential for significant gains but also substantial losses. The futures markets are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the U.S. to prevent abusive and fraudulent activities.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp

","The text presents an overview of Forex (FX), a global electronic marketplace for trading international currencies and currency derivatives. Forex pairs (example: USD/CAD, EUR/USD, USD/JPY) trade in lots, called micro, mini, and standard lots. The forex market is massive, with over $5 trillion traded per day. The market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week across major financial centers worldwide. Traders profit from the difference between their transaction prices. Two types of transactions are spot transactions, which are immediate, and forward transactions, which are for a future date. There's also mention of forex futures, contracts to deliver a set amount of currency at a future date. The forex market differs from other markets due to fewer regulations, no central overseeing bodies or clearinghouses, and the allowance for high leverage. Forex trading can be risky and complex, but accessible, as one can start with around $100. However, potential risks should not be underestimated.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp

Thesamecanbesaidforothertypesofinvestments.Realestatedevelopment projectswith more risk may carry greater upside than established operatingproperties. Meanwhile cryptocurrencies with longer histories and greater adoption such as Bitcoin carry less risk relative to smaller market cap coins or tokens. Diversification may not be the best strategy for investors wanting to maximize theirreturns. Consider YOLO you only live once strategies where 100% of capital is placed in a high-risk investment. Though there is a higher probability of making life-changing money there is also the highest probability of losing it due to poor diversification. Maturity Lengths Specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds different term lengths impact risk profiles. Generally the longer the maturity the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bonds prices due to changes in interest rates. Short-term bonds tend to offer lower interest rates however they also tend to be less impacted by uncertainty in future yield curves. Investors more comfortable with risk may consider adding longer term bonds that tend to pay higher degrees of interest. Maturity length is also prevalent in other asset classes. Consider the difference between short-term lease agreements for residential properties i.e. up to one year and long-term lease agreements for commercial properties i.e. sometimes five years or greater. Though there is more security in collecting rent revenue by locking into a long-term agreement investors sacrifice flexibility to increase prices or change tenants. Physical Locations Foreign vs. Domestic Investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. For example forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japan's economy in the same way. Therefore holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn. Alternatively there maybe a greater potential upside with associated higher degrees of risk when diversifying across developed and emerging countries. Consider Pakistan's current classification as a frontier market participant recently downgraded from an emerging market participant. Investors willing to take on higher levels of risk may want to consider the higher growth potential of smaller yet-to-be-fully established markets such as Pakistan. Tangibility Financial instruments such as stocks and bonds are intangible investments they cannot be physically touched or felt. On the other hand tangible investments such as land real estate farmland precious metals or commodities can be touched and have real-world applications. These real assets have different investment profiles as they can be consumed rented developed or treated differently than intangible or digital assets. There are also unique risks specific to tangible assets. Real property can be vandalized physically stolen damaged by natural conditions or become obsolete. Real assets may also require storage insurance or security costs to carry. Though the revenue stream differs from financial instruments the input costs to protect tangible assets are also different. Diversification Across Platforms Regardless of how an investor considers building their portfolio another aspect of diversification relates to how those assets are held. Though this is not an implication of the investments risk it is an additional risk worth considering as it may be diversifiable. For example consider an individual with 400,000 of U.S.currency. In all three of the situations below the investor has the same asset allocation. However their risk profile is different: The individual may deposit 200,000 at one bank and 200,000 at a second bank. Both deposits are under the FDIC insurance limit per bank and are fully insured. The individual may deposit 400,000 at a single bank. Only a portion of the deposit is covered by insurance. In addition should that single bank experience a bank run the individual may not have immediate access to cash. The individual may physically store 400,000 of cash in their home. Though immediately accessible the individual will not yield any interest or growth on their cash. In addition the individual may lose capital in the event of theft, fire or by misplacing it. The same concept above relates to almost every asset class. For example, Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Investors holding cryptocurrency with the exchange experienced the inability to withdraw ortransferfunds. Had investors diversified across platforms the risk of loss would have been spread across different exchanges. Consider different strategies to offset technology risk and physical risk. For example owning physical gold bars and gold ETFs diversifies your portfolio across various risks. If your physical holdings were to be stolen at least 100% of your gold ownership was not lost. Diversification and Retail Investors Time and budget constraints can make it difficult for non institutional investors i.e. individuals to create an adequately diversified portfolio. This challenge is a key to why mutual funds are so popular with retail investors. Buying shares in a mutual fund offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments. While mutual funds provide diversification across various asset classes exchange-traded funds ETFs afford investor access to narrow markets such as commodities and international plays that would ordinarily be difficult to access. An individual with a 100,000 portfolio can","Diversification is a risk management strategy that involves mixing a variety of investments within a portfolio in an effort to minimize exposure to any one asset or risk. This method is often implemented by investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and cryptocurrency. Diversification can also be achieved by investing in different nations, industries, company sizes, or term lengths for income-generating investments. Studies have shown that a well-diversified portfolio consisting of 25 to 30 stocks is the most effective at reducing risk. Also, the benefits of diversification only apply if the portfolio's contents are not perfectly correlated and respond differently to market influences. A range of strategies exists for diversifying holdings, from investing across different asset classes, industries, sectors, market capitalizations, risk profiles, term lengths and physical locations to tangible versus intangible investments. Diversification is also essential across platforms that hold the assets. Obtaining an adequately diversified portfolio can be challenging for non-institutional investors or individuals. However, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer relatively inexpensive ways to achieve diversification.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp

Personal Finance Budgeting and Saving, Personal Loans, Insurance, Mortgages, Credit and Debt, Student Loans, Taxes, Credit Cards, Financial Literacy, Retirement. What Is Asset Allocation and Why Is It Important By James Chen. Asset allocation is how investors divide their portfolios among different assets that might include equities, fixed-income assets, and cash and its equivalents. Investors ordinarily aim to balance risks and rewards based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and the investment horizon. Key Takeaways Asset allocation is how investors split up their portfolios among different kinds of assets. The three main asset classes are equities, fixed income, and cash and cash equivalents. Each asset class has different risks and return potentials so each will behave differently over time. No simple formula can find the right asset allocation for every individual investor. Why Is Asset Allocation Important? There's no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone, but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors make. Selecting individual securities within an asset class is done only after you decide how to divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. This will largely determine your investment results. Investors use different asset allocations for distinct goals. Someone saving to buy a new car in the next year might invest those savings in a conservative mix of cash, certificates of deposit, and short-term bonds. However, individuals saving for retirement decades away typically invest most of their retirement accounts in stocks, because they have a lot of time to ride out the market's short-term fluctuations. Risk tolerance plays a key factor as well. Those uncomfortable investing in stocks may put their money in a more conservative asset class, despite having a long-term investment horizon. How Do Economic Changes Affect Asset Allocation Strategies? Economic cycles of growth and contraction greatly affect how you should allocate your assets. During bull markets, investors ordinarily prefer growth-oriented assets like stocks to profit from better market conditions. Alternatively, during downturns or recessions, investors tend to shift toward more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents, which can help preserve capital. The Bottom Line Most financial professionals will tell you that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors can make. The selection of individual securities is secondary to how assets are allocated in stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents, which will play more of a role in your investment results.

","This article written by James Chen focuses on the concept and importance of asset allocation in financial management. Asset allocation, according to the article, pertains to the strategy of dividing an investor's portfolio among various asset types such as equities, fixed-income assets, and cash or its equivalents. The aim is to balance risks and rewards according to a person's financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. The three major asset classes have differing risk levels and return potentials, thus their performance varies over time. There's no universal formula to determine the ideal asset allocation as it is highly individualized. The article emphasizes that the choice of individual securities is secondary to asset allocation, which plays a larger role in the outcome of investment decisions. The author also highlights how economic cycles and personal goals can affect asset allocation strategies. The sources referenced in the piece include primary materials like white papers, government data, original reporting, and interviews with industry experts.

This method is often seen as attractive due to robust returns resulting from investing in successful young or emerging companies. However, it also poses considerable risk, as these companies are largely unproven in their sector or industry. Highlighting the complexity and subjective nature of identifying potential growth, the text explains the importance of evaluating factors such as historical and future earnings growth, profit margins, returns on equity (ROE), and share price performance. The contribution of Thomas Rowe Price Jr., known as the father of growth investing, and other notable figures like Philip Fisher and Peter Lynch are also discussed. The value of this approach is exemplified with Amazon Inc., which despite its size and high price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, is still considered a growth stock due to its anticipated continuing high earnings per share (EPS) growth.

37,37,37,"""BehavioralFinanceCorporateFinanceInstituteMenu. What is Behavioral Finance? Behavioral finance is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It also includes the subsequent effect on the markets. It focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control and are influenced by their own biases. 

Traditional Financial Theory: In order to better understand behavioral finance, let's first look at traditional financial theory. Traditional finance includes the following beliefs: Both the market and investors are perfectly rational, Investors truly care about utilitarian characteristics, Investors have perfect self-control. They are not confused by cognitive errors or information processing errors. 

Behavioral Finance Theory: Now let's compare traditional financial theory with behavioral finance. Traits of behavioral finance are: Investors are treated as normal, not rational, They actually have limits to their self-control, Investors are influenced by their own biases, Investors make cognitive errors that can lead to wrong decisions.

Decision-Making Errors and Biases: Let’s explore some of the buckets or building blocks that make up behavioral finance. Behavioral finance views investors as normal but being subject to decision-making biases and errors. We can break down the decision-making biases and errors into at least four buckets. 

Self-Deception: The concept of self-deception is a limit to the way we learn. When we mistakenly think we know more than we actually do we tend to miss information that we need to make an informed decision. 

Heuristic Simplification: We can also scope out a bucket that is often called heuristic simplification. Heuristic simplification refers to information-processing errors.

Emotion: Another behavioral finance bucket is related to emotion but we're not going to dwell on this bucket in this introductory session. Basically, emotion in behavioral finance refers to our making decisions based on our current emotional state. Our current mood may take our decision-making off track from rational thinking.

Social Influence: What we mean by the social bucket is how our decision-making is influenced by others.

Top 10 Biases in Behavioral Finance: Behavioral finance seeks an understanding of the impact of personal biases on investors. Here is a list of common financial biases: Overconfidence and illusion of control, Self Attribution Bias, Hindsight Bias, Confirmation Bias, The Narrative Fallacy, Representative Bias, Framing Bias, Anchoring Bias, Loss Aversion, Herding Mentality.

Overcoming Behavioral Finance Issues: There are ways to overcome negative behavioral tendencies in relation to investing. Here are some strategies you can use to guard against biases. 

Focus on the Process: There are two approaches to decision-making Reflexive and Reflective. Relying on reflexive decision-making makes us more prone to deceptive biases and emotional and social influences. Establishing logical decision-making processes can help protect you from such errors. Get yourself focused on the process rather than the outcome. 

Prepare Plan and Pre-Commit: Behavioral finance teaches us to invest by preparing, by planning, and by making sure we pre-commit.""","Behavioral finance is a study that delves into the psychology of investors or financial analysts and its subsequent influence on markets, emphasizing that investors are not always rational and are subject to their personal biases. Contrary to the traditional financial theory, which assumes that investors and markets are perfectly rational, have perfect self-control and are focused on utilitarian characteristics, behavioral finance posits that investors are normal, but they have limits to their self-control, are influenced by their biases, and make cognitive errors leading to wrong decisions. Various factors are explored such as self-deception, heuristic simplification, emotion, and social influence, that contribute to decision-making biases and errors. A list of common biases in finance includes overconfidence and illusion of control, self-attribution bias, hindsight bias, confirmation bias, the narrative fallacy, representative bias, framing bias, anchoring bias, loss aversion, and herding mentality.

38,38,38,"""""""Prospect Theory: Overview, Phases and Features

What is Prospect Theory?
Prospect theory is a psychology theory that describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and uncertainty. It holds that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains. Given the choice of equal probabilities, most people would choose to retain the wealth that they already have rather than risk the chance to increase their current wealth. People are usually averse to the possibility of losing such that they would rather avoid a loss rather than take a risk to make an equivalent gain.

History of Prospect Theory
The prospect theory is sometimes referred to as the loss-aversion theory. The theory was introduced by two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, to describe how humans make decisions when presented with several choices. The theory was contained in the paper “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk” that was published in the Econometrica journal in 1979. Since it was developed, the prospect theory has been used in various disciplines. It is used to evaluate various aspects of political decision-making in international relations.

Phases of Prospect Theory
The theory describes the decision-making process in two phases which include:

1. Editing phase: The editing phase refers to how people involved in decision-making characterize the options for choice or the framing effects. The effects explain how a person’s choice is influenced by the wording, order or method in which the choices are presented. An example to demonstrate the framing effect can be the choices that cancer patients are given. Usually, cancer patients are presented with the choice of undergoing surgery or chemotherapy to treat their illnesses, and they make a decision based on whether the outcome statistics are presented in terms of survival rates or mortality rates. Once the choices have been framed ready for decision-making, the theory enters the second phase.

2. Evaluation phase: In the evaluation phase, people tend to behave as if they would make a decision based on the potential outcomes and choose the option with a higher utility. The phase uses statistical analysis to measure and compare the outcomes of each prospect. The evaluation phase comprises two indices i.e. the value function and the weighting function, which are used to compare the prospects.

Features of the Prospect Theory
The prospects theory comes with the following characteristics:

1. Certainty: When presented with several options to choose from, humans show a strong preference for the option with certainty. They are willing to sacrifice the option that offers more potential income in order to achieve more certainty.
 
2. Small probabilities: People tend to discount very small probabilities, even if there is a possibility of losing all their wealth. By discounting the small probabilities, people end up choosing higher-risk options with higher probabilities.
 
3. Relative positioning: People tend to focus less on their final income or wealth and more on the relative gains or losses that they will get.

4. Loss aversion: People tend to give more weight to losses rather than gains made by taking a certain option.

Criticism of Prospect Theory
One of the criticisms of the prospect theory is that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about. The criticism comes from other psychologists who note that factors such as human emotional and affective responses that are important in the decision-making process are absent in the model. The theory is also criticized for the inadequate framing theory that explains why actors generate the frames they use. Decision-makers often need to deal with competing frames across various issues.""""""","The article outlines the basics of Prospect Theory, a psychological concept explaining how people make decisions when faced with risk, uncertainty, and varying probabilities. According to this theory, people usually prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains and value the wealth they have more heavily than the potential for increased wealth. Conceived by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979, Prospect Theory has influenced fields across disciplines, including international relations. The theory details two phases of decision making: the editing phase, which involves framing choices, and the evaluation phase, where potential outcomes and their utilities are considered. The theory underscores several notable behavioral features, such as a preference for certainty, discounting of small probabilities, focus on relative gains and losses, and a significant aversion to loss. Despite its widespread application, critics argue that Prospect Theory lacks comprehensive psychological explanations for the decision-making process it circumscribes, including factors like emotional responses and rationale behind frame selection.",https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/prospect-theory/

41,41,41,"""""""The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress in response to financial industry behavior that led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. It sought to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers. Named for sponsors Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the act contains numerous provisions spelled out over 848 pages that were to be implemented over a period of several years. Key takeaways: The Dodd-Frank Act targeted financial system sectors that were believed to have caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The institutions considered responsible for the 2007-2008 financial crisis included banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies. In 2018, Congress passed a new law that rolled back some of Dodd-Frank's restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a massive piece of financial reform legislation that was passed in 2010 during the Obama administration. Commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act or Dodd-Frank, it established a number of new government agencies tasked with overseeing the various components of the law and by extension, various aspects of the financial system. The 2007-2008 financial crisis is perhaps the worst economic catastrophe to befall the country and the world since the Wall Street crash in 1929. Broadly speaking, it was caused by greed-driven behavior and lax oversight of financial institutions. The loosening of financial industry regulations in the decades leading up to 2007 allowed various types of institutions in the U.S. financial services industry to lend money in ways that were riskier than ever before. The housing sector, in particular, experienced massive growth that couldn't be supported. The bubble burst, sending the banking industry and global stock markets into a downfall. It created the worst global recession in generations. Dodd-Frank was created to keep anything similar from ever happening again. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2007-2008. Components of the Dodd-Frank Act: The law also provides for liquidations or restructurings via the Orderly Liquidation Fund. This fund was established to assist with the dismantling of financial companies that have been placed in receivership to prevent tax dollars from being used to prop up such firms. The council has the authority to break up banks that are considered so large as to pose systemic risk. It can also force banks to increase their reserve requirements. Similarly, the new Federal Insurance Office was tasked with identifying and monitoring insurance companies that were also considered too big to fail. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) established under Dodd-Frank was given the job of preventing predatory mortgage lending and helping consumers understand the terms of a mortgage before agreeing to it. This reflected the widespread sentiment that the subprime mortgage market was the underlying cause of the 2007-2008 catastrophe. The CFPB deters mortgage brokers from earning higher commissions for closing loans with higher fees and/or higher interest rates. Volcker Rule: The Volcker Rule restricts how banks can invest, limits speculative trading, and eliminates proprietary trading. Banks are not allowed to be involved with hedge funds or private equity firms, which are considered too risky. The act also contains a provision for regulating derivatives, such as the credit default swaps that were widely blamed for contributing to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Dodd-Frank set up centralized exchanges for swaps trading to reduce the possibility of counterparty default. It required greater disclosure of swaps trading information to increase transparency in those markets. The Volcker Rule also regulates financial firms' use of derivatives in an attempt to prevent too big to fail institutions from taking large risks that might wreak havoc on the broader economy. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Office of Credit Ratings: Dodd-Frank established the SEC Office of Credit Ratings because credit rating agencies had been accused of giving out misleading, favorable investment ratings in the lead-up to the financial crisis. The office is charged with ensuring that agencies provide meaningful and reliable credit ratings of the businesses, municipalities, and other entities that they evaluate. Whistleblower Program: Dodd-Frank also strengthened and expanded the existing whistleblower program promulgated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002. Specifically, it established a mandatory bounty program under which whistleblowers can receive from 10% to 30% of the proceeds from a litigation settlement, broadened the scope of a covered employee by including employees of a company's subsidiaries and affiliates, and extended the statute of limitations under which whistleblowers can bring forward a claim against their employer from 90 to 180 days after a violation is discovered. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act: When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, he pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank. Siding with critics, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which rolled back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It was signed into law by then-President Trump on May 24, 2018. These are some of the provisions of that law and some of the areas in which previous standards were loosened: The new law eased the Dodd-Frank regulations for small and regional banks by increasing the asset threshold for the application of prudential standards, stress test requirements, and mandatory risk committees. For institutions that have custody of clients' assets but do not function as lenders or traditional bankers, the new law provided for lower capital requirements and leverage ratios. The new law exempted escrow requirements for residential mortgage loans held by a depository institution or credit union under certain conditions. It also directed the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to set up standards for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to consider alternative credit scoring methods. The law exempted lenders with assets of less than $10 billion from requirements of the Volcker Rule and imposed less stringent reporting and capital norms on small lenders. The law required that the three major credit reporting agencies allow consumers to freeze their credit files free of charge as a way of deterring fraud. After Joseph Biden was elected president in 2020, the CFPB focused on rescinding rules from the Trump era that were in direct conflict with the charter of the CFPB. The Biden administration has also announced its intent to re-establish rules against other forms of predatory lending, such as payday loans, and on June 30, 2023, Biden signed a law to overturn the OCC's payday lending regulations. Additionally, subprime auto loan practices are being addressed by the CFPB. Criticism of the Dodd-Frank Act: Proponents of Dodd-Frank believed that the law would prevent the economy from experiencing a crisis like that of 2007-2008 and protect consumers from many of the abuses that contributed to the crisis. Detractors, however, have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, they contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions, despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis. Several financial world notables have also argued that while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints also make for a more illiquid market overall. The higher reserve requirements under Dodd-Frank mean that banks must keep a higher percentage of their assets in cash. This decreases the amount that they are able to hold in marketable securities. In effect, this limits the bond market-making role that banks have traditionally undertaken. With banks unable to play the part of a market maker, prospective buyers are likely to have a hard time finding counteracting sellers. More importantly, prospective sellers may find it more difficult to find counteracting buyers. What Was the Purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act: Dodd-Frank is intended to curb the extremely risky financial industry activities that led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Its goal was, and still is, to protect consumers and taxpayers from egregious practices like predatory lending. Is the Dodd-Frank Act Still in Effect: Yes, it is, however, its regulatory strength was diluted with the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. What Are Some Criticisms of the Dodd-Frank Act: Detractors of the Dodd-Frank Act have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, critics contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions, despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis. What Was the Impact of the 2018 Rollback of Dodd-Frank Regulations: In 2018, the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act rolled back numerous regulations put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bottom Line: The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, was a direct response to the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the ensuing government bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This law established a wide range of reforms throughout the entire financial system, with the purpose of preventing a repeat of the 2007-2008 crisis and the need for further government bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act also included additional protections for consumers. Although the Trump administration reversed and weakened several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly those affecting consumers, the Biden administration intends to re-establish and strengthen the previous reversals to protect individuals who may be subject to predatory lending practices in industries like for-profit education and automobiles.""""""

The new version does the same but swaps in crypto to reflect the ecosystem's spread. Last week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed titled 'Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto', where he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and stressed on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. A survey conducted by Citi showed that 92% of institutions see value in tokenization. The Red Cross and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have both mentioned ongoing work around blockchain.
However, the spotlight has also been cast on recent high-profile distributed ledger failures. IBM and Maersk announced the closure of their blockchain-based supply chain joint venture TradeLens, the Australian Stock Exchange canceled its blockchain project due to delays and cost overruns. Despite these setbacks, the persistence of some projects, new use cases under trial, and a changing participant profile indicate success. For instance, a state-owned bank has successfully issued blockchain-based assets, while several banks and governments are testing the process with intriguing innovations. Major traditional asset managers are issuing blockchain-based tokens representing funds. Vanguard Australia is using a distributed ledger for back-office settlement, Starbucks has launched an NFT experience for its Rewards users, and Goldman Sachs have carried out separate distributed ledger tests.
As the dust settled on the FTX fallout and the crypto ecosystem reevaluated, more prominence has been predicted for enterprise blockchain milestones. However, it was also stressed that the crypto ecosystem is big enough for a number of approaches to coexist. The narrative shift will act as a refreshing reminder that the potential goes beyond sentiment recovery, regulatory clarity, and deeper understanding. Blockchain and crypto, thus, can move forward together.""","The article ""Blockchain vs. Crypto: Not What It Seems"" discusses the renewed significance of the 'blockchain not bitcoin' mantra, highlighting the overlapping yet distinct role of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

51,51,51,"""Cryptocurrency Explained With Pros and Cons for Investment. By Jake Frankenfield. Updated November 02, 2023. What Is Cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. 

Understanding Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. Crypto refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. 

Types of Cryptocurrency: Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. 

Are Cryptocurrencies Legal: Fiat currencies derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. But cryptocurrencies are not backed by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. In the U.S., regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry. 

Are Cryptocurrencies Safe Investments: Cryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses due to scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, the technical complexity of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users. 

Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are trade-offs involved. 

How Do You Buy Cryptocurrencies: You can purchase cryptocurrency from popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, apps such as Cash App, or through brokers. 

What Is the Point of Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrencies are a new paradigm for money. They promise to streamline existing financial architecture to make it faster and cheaper. 

What Are the Most Popular Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, followed by other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, Solana, and Cardano. 

The Bottom Line: Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative and it is important to understand the risks involved before investing.""","The article, ""Cryptocurrency Explained With Pros and Cons for Investment"" by Jake Frankenfield, provides an in-depth explanation of cryptocurrency, its types, legality, safety, and how to buy and use it. Cryptocurrency is a decentralized, digital or virtual currency secured using cryptographic systems, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. It exists on decentralized networks using blockchain technology, a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers. The article further explains the different types of cryptocurrencies, highlighting Ethereum's ether intended for validating transactions and opening blocks. Yet, legal ambiguity exists due to the lack of public or private backup. While the underlying technology is secure, the investment in crypto remains unstable due to scams, hacks, and volatility. Despite the risks, cryptocurrencies promise to make financial transactions faster and cheaper.

52,52,52,"""Blockchain is a decentralized record-keeping technology that stores data unalterably on a public ledger. The fact that it is decentralized, censorship-proof, immutable, and tamper-proof makes blockchain a completely secure technology. In a blockchain network, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), every node works to prevent errors and verify transactions. While blockchain can be thought of as a database, it has many aspects that distinguish it from traditional databases. The first and most famous thing to represent the use of blockchain is Bitcoin.

Blockchain is a distributed, peer-to-peer ledger that enables users to transact without any centralized authority. The consensus about the state of balances and transactions among network validators is reached via a consensus mechanism with Proof-of-Work used by Bitcoin and Proof-of-Stake used by Ethereum being the most popular ones. Contrary to popular belief, blockchain technology is not just related to cryptocurrencies. Judiciary, banks, logistics companies, the entertainment industry, and many other sectors are putting ever more emphasis on blockchain solutions. 

Smart contract capabilities, tokenization, and immutability are major benefits that blockchain technology offers to companies. Blockchain technology is essentially a decentralized data-storing digital ledger. When anyone wishes to make a transaction on the blockchain network, an entry in a blockchain block representing that transaction is created.""

Blockchain technology continues to attract the attention of more industries and companies over the years. Blockchain projects are built around three key features: scalability, decentralization, and security. Smart contracts are arguably the biggest and most striking capability that blockchain technology has brought. Blockchain networks that provide scalability and security at the same time may have to renounce decentralization.

Promising smart contracts, cross-border peer-to-peer payments, decentralized finance, monetization metaverse, and more, blockchain technology is rapidly increasing use cases around the world. More users, companies, and governments are discovering how blockchain technology can help them and are supporting its further development. This guide contains information on how blockchains work, what they do, what innovations they bring, and more. Even though we've covered blockchain technology as the foundation, this content is just the tip of the iceberg.","Blockchain is a decentralized technology that securely maintains records with features like transparency, immutability, and tamper-proof mechanisms.

The best robo-advisors offer easy account setup, robust goal planning, account services, and portfolio management. They also offer security features, comprehensive education, and low fees. 

Robo-advisors are often inexpensive and require low opening balances, making them available to retail investors. They are best suited for traditional investing and aren't the best options for more complex issues such as estate planning. 

The first robo-advisors, Betterment and Wealthfront, launched in 2008. Today, most robo-advisors use passive indexing strategies that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). They also can handle much more sophisticated tasks such as tax-loss harvesting, investment selection, and retirement planning.

The industry has experienced explosive growth. Client assets managed by robo-advisors are expected to reach 3 trillion in 2023 and 5 trillion worldwide by 2027.

The majority of robo-advisors use modern portfolio theory or some variant to build passive, indexed portfolios for their users. Once portfolios are established, robo-advisors continue to monitor them to ensure that the optimal asset-class weightings are maintained even after market moves.

Automated services are also ill-equipped to deal with unexpected crises or extraordinary situations. For example, robo-advisors won't know if you're between jobs or dealing with an unexpected expense, your funds could be drained unexpectedly by automatic withdrawals.

Robo-advisors operate on the assumption that you have defined goals and a clear understanding of your financial circumstances, investment concepts, and potential investment outcomes.

Today, most robo-advisors use passive indexing strategies that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Some robo-advisors offer optimized portfolios for socially responsible investing (SRI), halal investing, or tactical strategies that mimic hedge funds.

Robo-advisors have broken down some of the traditional barriers between the financial services world and average consumers. Most robo-advisors charge annual flat fees of less than 0.4 per specific amount managed. That is much less than the typical 1% charged by a human financial planner or more for commission-based accounts.

Robo-advisors are good entry-level options if you have a small account and limited investment experience. You may find them lacking if you need services like estate planning, complicated tax management, trust fund administration, and retirement planning. Automated services are also ill-equipped to deal with unexpected crises or extraordinary situations.

Robo-advisors hold the same legal status as human advisors. Accordingly, they must be registered with the SEC and are subject to the same securities laws and regulations as traditional broker-dealers. Most robo-advisors are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

The primary way that most robo-advisors get paid is through a wrap fee based on assets under management (AUM). While traditional human financial advisors typically charge 1% or more of AUM per year, many robo-advisors charge around 0.3% of AUM per year.

59,59,59,"""""""What is Online Banking Definition and How It Works: Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking. Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking you can access through a computer or app.

Key Takeaways:
-Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet.
-You aren't required to visit a bank branch in order to complete basic online banking transactions.
-You need a device, an Internet connection, and a bank card to register for online banking.

Understanding Online Banking: With online banking, you aren't required to visit a bank branch to complete most of your basic banking transactions. You can do all of this at your own convenience, wherever you want, at home, at work, or on the go. Online banking can be done using a browser or app. Mobile banking is online banking that is done on a phone or tablet. Using online banking requires a computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other device, plus an Internet connection, and a bank or debit card.

Banking transactions offered online vary by institution. Most banks generally offer basic services such as transfers and bill payments. Banks also offer increased accessibility to banking features, reducing the need for physical branches.

Advantages of Online Banking: Convenience is a major advantage of online banking. Basic banking transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds between accounts can easily be done anytime of the day or night, seven days a week.

Disadvantages of Online Banking: For a novice online banking customer, using electronic systems for the first time may present challenges that prevent transactions from being processed, which is why some people prefer face-to-face transactions with a teller.

The Bottom Line: Online banking is a fast, inexpensive, and convenient way to handle many of your everyday financial transactions. If you already have a bank, you likely have access to online banking, all you need to do is register. And while you can use a traditional brick-and-mortar bank's online banking features, choosing an online-only bank for all of your banking needs might boost the interest you earn on savings and help save money on fees.""""""","The article provides an in-depth understanding of online banking, a convenient method of conducting financial transactions using the internet, also known as web banking.

It requires a device with an internet connection, a browser or app, and a bank or debit card. The range of services differs among banks, but most offer basic transactions like fund transfers and bill payments, thus driving their increased accessibility and reducing the need for physical branches. Despite its many advantages, including convenience and round-the-clock availability, online banking can present difficulties for new users, leading some to prefer traditional face-to-face transactions. The article concludes that online banking is a fast, cost-effective, and efficient way to manage daily financial activities. While traditional banks provide online banking services, opting for an online-only bank could yield higher interest on savings and result in significant savings on banking fees.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onlinebanking.asp

61,61,61,"""""""Nine Key Reasons Online Banking Benefits Small Business. With online banking services companies can save both time and resources while also keeping track of their expenses in a convenient and cost-efficient way. Gone are the days when a company representative had to go to the bank in-person to deposit a check or withdraw cash for wages as all of these operations can now be done almost exclusively online. Small business owners especially stand to gain a lot from using their banks online services to generate value and save time--time that can be dedicated to growing the organization instead. To help business owners better navigate the world of online financial operations we asked nine members of Forbes Finance Council for their opinions on some of the key benefits of online banking that entrepreneurs tend to overlook. Members explain why online banking is great for small businesses. 

1. Seamless Syncing With Accounting 
  Accounting is one of the biggest pains for business owners. Online banking and online accounting systems have made it easier than ever to make sure you have all of your transactions synced with your accounting system without needing to spend hours manually adding transactions. This saves business owners time and money and makes it easier to have up-to-date financial reports.- Brian Hayes NOW CFO 

2. Improved Security 
  At some point you may need others to manage your books. Online banking allows small businesses to customize employee access. Since not all employees need access to all accounts online banking enables features to share certain content with select employee logins. The online account can be set up on a need-to-know basis and thus improves your overall company financial security.- Jared Weitz United Capital Source Inc. 

3. Better Organization
  A great overlooked benefit to online banking is how it helps you organize your finances. The convenience of having your account at your fingertips pairs with the opportunity to view all your transactions in one easy place. You can monitor where your money goes, stay on top of bills and even set up recurring payments. Its a perk that is definitely overlooked.- Greg Herlean Horizon Trust 

4. Worldwide Access 
  The days of having to call your bank or wait for a paper statement in order to check your balance or see what has cleared already are gone. You can now just login from almost anywhere in the world to check account balances, verify payment or confirm a check has cleared. The sheer level of convenience of this alone makes it well worth learning how to use online banking for business.- Danielle Kunkle Roberts Boomer Benefits 

5. No Branches No Paperwork 
  Done right online small business banking has the potential to vastly improve business back-office productivity. The impact can be tremendous. No more waiting in line at branches. No faxing forms. No customer service hold. Many banks have created online banking portals that still pull business owners into branches or keep them on hold. Look for native digital offerings instead.- Eytan Bensoussan NorthOne 

6. Fraud Alerts 
  Online banking allows you to see your transactions in real-time and if something seems off your bank will alert you. That kind of security is invaluable.- Jeff Pitta Medicare Plan Finder 

7. Easy Tracking 
  Online banking offers you an easy-to-follow audit trail. When you opt to use bill pay in online banking, tracking your incomes and outflows is effortless. It's great during tax time for recovering not only business expense details but also tracking down personal expenses for tax preparation.- Justin Goodbread Heritage Investors 

8. Mobile Check Deposit 
  One of my favorite features is the mobile check deposit. Now you can take a picture of your check and deposit it through your bank's mobile app.- David Haass Elite Insurance Partners LLC 

9. Easier Vendor Payments 
  One overlooked feature is business bill pay. A simple setup in your bank's bill pay and a check is mailed directly to your vendor and as an added bonus the check is certified funds. Alternatively you can ACH the payment if its an ongoing relationship--even businesses like direct deposit.- Vlad Rusz VladCorp.

62,62,62,"""""""Mobile Payments vs. Credit Card Payments. Mobile payments have never been more popular. People are using mobile payments these days to complete quick transactions through their mobile devices. You'll notice a few distinct differences when looking at mobile and credit card payments. Many of these entail the technologies used and how people may find mobile payments to be more useful for their needs.

The Concept of a Mobile Payment
A mobile payment entails a transaction made through a mobile device. The customer can use a smartphone, smartwatch or even a wristband. The user will pay for something with a mobile payment solution like Apple Pay or Google Pay. The system incorporates credit card or bank data in one platform. The user will transmit one's payment information from that account to the retailer to complete the purchase. 

Mobile payments come from a digital wallet. The wallet will link to an appropriate interface or platform. 
The wallet will include the bank or card info. The mobile payment system takes the payment info from the digital wallet and uses it to cover the transaction. Some digital wallets like what PayPal uses can include specific amounts of money someone withdraws from a bank or credit line before spending that total. The systems simplifies how people can pay for their purchases. Customers don't have to get a physical credit card out to complete a transaction. The buyer will have more control over the purchase experience especially as that person can handle the payment in less time. The customer may also feel more comfortable with the transaction process when using a mobile payment system.

A Safer Solution
Mobile transactions are safer. A mobile payment can help the customer send data from a digital wallet to the retailer completing the transaction without providing any cards. The mobile payment system ensures full security over a deal. You won't see that same security with a credit card. Although credit cards have evolved to feature a chip-based system that is harder to hack, there is always the potential for someone to steal a card. A person can always steal a card or its identifying numbers and use it to commit fraud. But with a mobile transaction, the thief would have to use a thumbprint scan or other system to confirm one's identity. It would be tough for that person to try and duplicate that thumbprint in this process. Many mobile devices are also locked through PINs or other biometric features so that adds extra security to the deal.

How People Get These Systems
People will apply for credit cards by filling out the proper forms for getting them ready. People will submit credit info to highlight their ability to pay their balances. Some people may be rejected for cards if they have poor credit ratings. The ones that do get accepted may be subject to high interest rates and restrictive charges.
A mobile payment is different as a customer will require a suitable payment app on one's device. Google Pay and Apple Pay are the most prominent apps although Samsung Pay is available on many Samsung devices. The user will link one's existing bank or card info to the app. The system is simple and gives the customer more power over how one will pay for items. Since people don't need credit to get a mobile payment account, you can expect these payments to be more common. People prefer payment choices that don't require lots of effort or risk. Some of these payments will entail direct bank transfers, making the transaction process easier to follow.

Convenience For the Customer
Customers also use mobile transactions because they are more convenient. There's no need for the customer to keep lots of cards on hand. The customer's payment info is all on the same mobile payment app. It takes less time to complete a mobile payment than it does to run a credit card. It is easier to track a phone or other smart device if it gets lost than if one's credit card was lost. Mobile payment platforms can inform customers of whatever coupons or other discounts they have stored with them. They will not forget about these like they would if they had traditional coupons they would use with a credit card.

What Systems Accept These
Most POS setups can accept credit cards with the technology being so common. But not all platforms can accept mobile payments. A POS system must support a system like Google Pay or Apple Pay to complete mobile payments. A POS setup can also work with different integrations with systems like PayPal, Venmo or anything else a customer wants to use. The extra effort necessary for accepting mobile payments makes it tough for some retailers to support them. As more people start using mobile payments and the technology becomes more common place, you can expect to find more POS solutions that can support mobile deals.

Will Mobile Payments Take Over
It is possible that mobile payments will become more popular than credit cards after awhile. It will take a long time before anyone can figure out what will happen. The problem with mobile payments is that many people are uncertain about how they work. They also might not have the mobile devices necessary to complete these payments. Some are also comfortable with credit cards, especially since chip-based ones are more secure than older magstripe models. You can expect mobile payments to become more prominent, especially as mobile devices become more accessible. Potential advances in payment technology will also help increase the chances for these payments to be popular and useful among people. Whatever happens, it will be exciting for people to see as they look at how payment trends change and people start to see what's more efficient and effective.""""""","The article primarily compares mobile payments with traditional credit card payments, highlighting the functioning, benefits, and pitfalls of each. Mobile payments are made through devices such as smartphones, utilizing digital wallets that are linked to credit cards or bank accounts. This mode of transaction is deemed convenient as they are generally faster and more secure, by obviating the need to carry physical cards and providing extra security features, such as thumbprint scans or PINs. Although not always universally accepted by retailers, the growing ubiquity of mobile devices and advancing technology suggest an increasing favour towards mobile payments. 

Comparatively, credit card payments might impose higher risks of fraud and are more complicated to obtain, involving submission of credit histories and the possibility of high-interest rates. However, many people continue to prefer them due to their prevalent technology and improved security with chip-based systems. The article concludes that while it is plausible that mobile payments might eventually outdo credit cards, the timeline and certainty of this shift are still unclear.",https://www.hostmerchantservices.com/2021/07/mobile-payments-vs-credit-card-payments/
