Coding Guidelines

Language Conventions
Snake Case: Utilize snake_case for variable names.

python
example_variable = "Hello, SkillUp!"
Documentation Practices
Proper Commenting: Add insightful comments to explain the why, not just the how.

javascript
// Looping through the array of elements.
for (let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
    // Performing an operation on each element.
    performOperation(elements[i]);
}

Version Control Etiquette
Frequent Commits: Maintain a consistent commit history for clarity.

bash
git commit -m "Feature: Implemented the navigation algorithm"
Collaborative Code Review
Mandatory Review Requests: Request at least one review before merging changes.

bash
git push origin feature/your-feature
Initiate the review request on GitHub for collective feedback.

Conclusion
By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure code consistency and collaborative excellence. Let's maintain a high standard in our coding practices.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
