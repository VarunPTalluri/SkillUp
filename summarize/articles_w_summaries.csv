What Is an Economic Indicator?

An economic indicator is a piece of economic data, usually of macroeconomic scale, that is used by analysts to interpret current or future investment possibilities. These indicators also help to judge the overall health of an economy. Economic indicators can be anything the investor chooses, but specific pieces of data released by the government and non-profit organizations have become widely followed. Such indicators include but aren't limited to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP), and unemployment figures.

Key Takeaways

An economic indicator is a macroeconomic measurement used by analysts to understand current and future economic activity and opportunity.

The most widely-used economic indicators come from data released by the government and non-profit organizations or universities.

Indicators can also be lagging, which means they report economic circumstances but only after the circumstance has materialized.

Indicators can give investors insight as to how trades may play out, though unreliability of data and inconsistency of variables may yield indicators less helpful.

Types of Economic Indicators

Economic indicators can be divided into categories or groups. Most of these economic indicators have a specific schedule for release, allowing investors to prepare for and plan on seeing certain information at certain times of the month and year.

Leading Indicators

Leading indicators, such as the yield curve, consumer durables, net business formations, and share prices, are used to predict the future movements of an economy. The numbers or data on these financial guideposts will move or change before the economy, thus their category's name. Consideration of the information from these indicators must be taken with a grain of salt, as they can be incorrect.

Coincident Indicators

Coincident indicators, which include such things as GDP, employment levels, and retail sales, are seen with the occurrence of specific economic activities. This class of metrics shows the activity of a particular area or region. These types of indicators also allow for policymakers to leverage real data without delay to make informed decisions.

Lagging Indicators

Lagging indicators, such as gross national product (GNP), CPI, unemployment rates, and interest rates, are only seen after a specific economic activity occurs. As the name implies, these data sets show information after the event has happened. This trailing indicator is a technical indicator that comes after large economic shifts.

Interpreting Economic Indicators

An economic indicator is only useful if one interprets it correctly. History has shown strong correlations between economic growth, as measured by GDP, and corporate profit growth. However, determining whether a specific company may grow its earnings based on one indicator of GDP is nearly impossible. 

The Stock Market As an Indicator

Leading indicators forecast where an economy is headed. One of the top leading indicators is the stock market itself. Though not the most critical leading indicator, it’s the one that most people look at. Because stock prices factor in forward-looking performance, the market can indicate the economy’s direction, if earnings estimates are accurate.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Economic Indicators

Pros of Economic Indicators

Economic indicators rely on data to substantiate predictions of what is to come in the future. When analyzed correctly, investors can capitalize on data to make successful trades or correctly assess future market conditions.

Cons of Economic Indicators

The obvious downside to economic indicators, at least leading or coincident indicators, is that they rely on some degree of forecasting. Therefore, economic indicators do not always predict the future correctly, and the recommended action to take may not play out as expected.

What Is the Most Important Economic Indicator?

For many, a country's GDP usually represents the best overall picture of a country's economic health.

Is Inflation an Economic Indicator?

Yes, inflation is a lagging indicator that is reported after a rise in prices has occurred.

What Are the Economic Indicators of a Strong Economy?

An economy may be strong if it has a robust amount of economic activity, and job growth.

Do Traders Use Economic Indicators?

Traders and investment professionals may use economic indicators to predict how broad economic policy will impact their trades or investment strategy.

The Bottom Line

Economic indicators are leading, coincident, or lagging figures that indicate broad conditions. Economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, or certain prices inform economics, companies, and investors of not only where the economy is today but perhaps where the economy may be headed. Economic indicators can be used to guide government policy or set investment strategies.""

","The article aims to explain the concept of economic indicators, their significance, their types, and their pros and cons. Economic indicators are data related to the macroeconomic scale that provide insights into current or future investment opportunities and the general health of an economy. Notably used economic indicators are GDP, CPI, and unemployment numbers. They can either be leading, coincident, or lagging, with each serving specific functions in economic forecasting. For instance, leading indicators, like share prices, predict future economic movements, while coincident indicators, like GDP, coincide with particular economic activities. Conversely, lagging indicators, like unemployment rates, are perceived only after specific economic activities occur. These indicators may be beneficial for investors and policymakers, but they can also be unreliable due to the inherent uncertainty of forecasting. Generally, the GDP serves as a comprehensive overview of a country's economic health, but other indicators like inflation and job growth are also significant. These economic indicators can assist traders and policymakers in making informed decisions based on the projected economic climate.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_indicator.asp

Leading indicators predict future movements of an economy, while coincident indicators report specific economic activities and lagging indicators reveal information after an economic event has occurred. Interpreting economic indicators correctly is crucial for understanding and predicting economic growth and corporate profit growth. Although economic indicators can provide useful insights, they rely on forecasting and may not always predict the future accurately.

1,1,1,"""Economic Indicators You Should Know for Investment

Economic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Metrics such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and written reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. Policymakers, notably those at the Federal Reserve, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going, but how fast it's getting there.

While these reports are often dry and data is raw, they still contains valuable information. It takes understanding how these indicators are calculated and their relative strengths and limitations, but then they can contribute to more thorough decision making. Knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful, as well as knowing the macroeconomic forecasts. It can be beneficial to read a report that analyzes the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations, seasonality figures, and year-over-year results. Investment advisors might also analyze recently released indicators.

Inflation indicators such as the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. For example, many investors will use the PPI to try and predict the upcoming CPI. Economic Output indicators like the gross domestic product (GDP) are significant, especially to equity investors focused on corporate profit growth.

The Institute for Supply Management's PMI report contains timely data and is ideal for investors. The relative order in which the indicators are presented does not change month to month, so investors might want to mark their calendars to inspect the areas of the economy that might change how they think about their investments or time horizon.

2,2,2,"""Financial Markets: Role in the Economy, Importance, Types, and Examples

Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs, including the stock market, bond market, forex market, and derivatives market. Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies.

Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs.

There are many kinds of financial markets, including (but not limited to) forex, money, stock, and bond markets.

These markets may include assets or securities that are either listed on regulated exchanges or trade over-the-counter (OTC).

Financial markets trade in all types of securities and are critical to the smooth operation of a capitalist society.

When financial markets fail, economic disruption, including recession and rising unemployment, can result.

Understanding the Financial Markets

Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of capitalist economies by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs. The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings.

The stock market is just one type of financial market. Financial markets are created when people buy and sell financial instruments, including equities, bonds, currencies, and derivatives. Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate.

Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value.

Types of Financial Markets

There are several different types of markets.

Stock Markets

Equities markets, are used by companies to raise capital and by investors to search for returns. 

Over-the-Counter Markets

An over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market—meaning it does not have physical locations, and trading is conducted electronically—in which market participants trade securities directly (meaning without a broker).

Bond Markets

A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate. Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations.

Money Markets

Typically, the money markets trade in products with highly liquid short-term maturities (less than one year) and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets.

Derivatives Markets

A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index).

Forex Market

The forex (foreign exchange) market is where participants can buy, sell, hedge, and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs. 

Commodities Markets

Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as agricultural products (e.g., corn, livestock, soybeans), energy products (oil, gas, carbon credits), precious metals (gold, silver, platinum), or ""soft"" commodities (such as cotton, coffee, and sugar).

Cryptocurrency Markets

Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online crypto exchanges.

Examples of Financial Markets

The above sections make clear that the ""financial markets"" are broad in scope and scale. To give two more concrete examples, we will consider the role of stock markets in bringing a company to IPO and the role of the OTC derivatives market in the 2008-09 financial crisis.

5,5,5,"""""""The 50/30/20 Budget Rule Explained With Examples

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren popularized the 50/20/30 budget rule in her book, All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan. The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings. This intuitive and straightforward rule can help you draw up a reasonable budget that you can stick to over time in order to meet your financial goals.

Key Takeaways:

The rule states that you should spend up to 50% of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do. The remaining half should be split up between 20% savings and debt repayment and 30% to everything else that you might want.

The rule is a template that is intended to help individuals manage their money and save for emergencies and retirement. 

The purpose of the 50/30/20 rule is to balance paying for necessities while being mindful of long-term savings and retirement.

The 50/30/20 rule can be simplified by setting up automatic deposits, using automatic payments, and tracking changes in income.

50%: Needs

Needs are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for survival. Half of your after-tax income should be all that you need to cover your needs and obligations. If you are spending more than that on your needs, you will have to either cut down on wants or try to downsize your lifestyle, perhaps to a smaller home or more modest car. Maybe carpooling or taking public transportation to work is a solution, or cooking at home more often. Examples of ""needs"" include but aren't limited to:

Rent or mortgage payments

Car payments

Groceries

Insurance and health care

Minimum debt payments

Utilities

30%: Wants

Wants are all the things you spend money on that are not absolutely essential. Anything in the ""wants"" bucket is optional if you boil it down. You can work out at home instead of going to the gym, cook instead of eating out, or watch sports on TV instead of getting tickets to the game.

This category also includes those upgrade decisions you make, such as choosing a costlier steak instead of a less expensive hamburger, buying a Mercedes instead of a more economical Honda, or choosing between watching television using an antenna for free or spending money to watch cable TV. Basically, wants are all those little extras you spend money on that make life more enjoyable and entertaining. In general, examples of ""wants"" include but aren't limited to:

New unnecessary clothes or accessories like handbags or jewelry

Tickets to sporting events

Vacations or other non-essential travel

The latest electronic gadget (especially an upgrade over a fully functioning prior model)

Ultra-high-speed Internet beyond your streaming needs

20%: Savings

Finally, try to allocate 20% of your net income to savings and investments. You should have at least three months of emergency savings on hand in case you lose your job or an unforeseen event occurs. After that, focus on retirement and meeting other financial goals down the road. Examples of savings could include:

Creating an emergency fund

Making IRA contributions to a mutual fund account

Investing in the stock market

Setting aside funds to buy physical property for long-term holding

Making debt repayments beyond minimum payments

If emergency funds are ever used, the first allocation of additional income should be to replenish the emergency fund account.

Importance of Savings

Americans are notoriously bad at saving, and the nation has extremely high levels of debt. The 50-20-30 rule is intended to help individuals manage their after-tax income, primarily to have funds on hand for emergencies and savings for retirement.

Saving for retirement is also a critical step as individuals are living longer. Calculating how much you will need for retirement and working towards that goal, beginning at a young age will ensure a comfortable retirement.

Benefits of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

The 50/30/20 rule can guide individuals to financial prosperity in a number of different ways. Potential benefits from these guidelines include:

Ease of Use: The 50/30/20 rule offers a straightforward framework for budgeting, making it simple to comprehend and apply. 

Enact Financial Balance: By using a budget, you may manage your money in a balanced way. 

Prioritize Vital Expenses: You can make sure that you cover your fundamental needs without going over budget or taking on too much debt by giving these basics top priority.

Emphasize Saving Goals: By allocating 20% of your income to savings, you can set up an emergency fund, prepare for retirement, pay off debt, invest, or pursue other financial goals.

Promote Long-Term Financial Security: Using these rules, you give your financial future priority by continuously setting aside 20% of your salary.

How to adopt the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

Here are some high-level tips on adopting a 50/30/20 budget relevant to all individuals.

Track Your Expenses: To better understand your spending habits, start by keeping track of your expenses for a month or two.

Understanding Your Income: The basis of the 50/30/20 budget is rooted in understanding what your income is.

Identify Your Critical Costs: This includes expenses such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, transportation expenses, insurance premiums, and debt repayments. 

Automate Your Savings: By automating the process, saving will be simpler. 

Maintain Consistency: Adopting the 50/30/20 budget guideline successfully requires maintaining consistency. 

Example of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

Imagine a person recently graduated from college and started her first full-time job. She wants to develop good financial habits from the beginning and has heard about the 50/30/20 budget rule.
After a few months, this young woman is promoted. Because her income changed, she reevaluates every budget amount and amends her budget as needed.

Should I Include Taxes in the Calculation of the 50/30/20 Rule?

Taxes are typically excluded from the calculation of the 50%, 30%, 20% rule since it focuses on allocating income after taxes. You should consider your after-tax income when applying the rule.

How Can I Budget Effectively Using the 50/30/20 Rule?

To budget effectively using the 50%, 30%, 20% rule, track your expenses, prioritize essential needs, be mindful of wants, and consistently allocate savings or debt repayment within the designated percentage.

Can I Use the 50/30/20 Rule to Save for Long-Term Goals?

Yes, the 50/30/20 rule can be used to save for long-term goals. Allocate a portion of the 20% to savings specifically for your long-term goals, such as a down payment on a house, education funds, or investments.

The Bottom Line

Saving is difficult, and life often throws unexpected expenses at us. By following the 50-20-30 rule, individuals have a plan with how they should manage their after-tax income. If they find that their expenditures on wants are more than 30%, they can find ways to reduce those expenses that will help direct funds to more important areas such as emergency money and retirement.

What Is an Emergency Fund?

The term “emergency fund” refers to money stashed away that people can use in times of financial distress. The purpose of an emergency fund is to improve financial security by creating a safety net that can be used to meet unanticipated expenses, such as an illness or major home repairs.

Assets in an emergency fund tend to be cash or other highly liquid assets. This reduces the need to either draw from high-interest debt options, such as credit cards or unsecured loans, or undermine your future security by tapping into retirement funds.

Key Takeaways

An emergency fund is a financial safety net for future mishaps and/or unexpected expenses.

Emergency funds should typically have three to six months’ worth of expenses, although the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown has led some experts to suggest up to one year’s worth.

Individuals should keep their emergency funds in accounts that are easily accessible and easily liquidated.

Savers can use tax refunds and other windfalls to build up their funds.

Some employers have established programs to encourage emergency fund saving.

Understanding Emergency Funds

You establish an emergency fund when you put away money that is intended to be used during times of financial hardship. This includes the loss of your job, a debilitating illness, or a major repair to your home or car—not to mention the kind of major economic crisis and lockdown that happened in 2020.

The best size for an emergency fund depends on a number of factors, including your financial situation, expenses, lifestyle, and debts. Many financial advisors recommend saving enough to cover anywhere from three to six months’ worth of expenses, which can help you weather a modest healthcare bill or a short bout of unemployment.

However, some experts argue for an even heftier cushion. Celebrity finance guru Suze Orman, for example, suggests an emergency fund that can handle up to eight months’ worth of outlays.

And she made that contention well before the 2020 crisis, a stark reminder of how sudden and deep an economic slump can be.

Individual circumstances may dictate the specific savings level with which you’re comfortable. For example, a single adult without children may be content covering three months of expenses, while the sole breadwinner for an entire family may want to have enough to cover half a year or more.

Research shows that many Americans are well short of the recommended range. In fact, a 2020 survey by the Federal Reserve found that more than one-fourth of Americans lacked the ability to cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalents. Among unemployed workers, that figure rose to 45%.

If you’re living paycheck to paycheck, you may want to start with more modest goals, such as putting 2% of your net income into a rainy day fund and slowly increasing your contribution rate every few months. Even a modest safety net can help buy you a little time should you face an unforeseen financial crisis.

It may be tempting to use your fund for incidental or frivolous purposes, so make sure that you don’t deplete this resource for any purpose other than an actual emergency.

How to Build an Emergency Fund

Starting early is the key to setting up an emergency fund, because it helps you build up a comfortable cushion against unexpected emergencies later in life.

Getting a start on emergency funds is relatively easy. Here are two simple ways to begin saving for one.

Set aside a comfortable amount from your salary each month.

Calculate your living expenses for the desired period, and make that your target for an emergency fund. You can then divert a portion of your paycheck—perhaps by setting up an automatic transfer—to that account each month. Once the fund is built up, invest extra savings for the long term or other goals, such as the down payment on a mortgage.

Once you’ve maxed out your retirement savings, that money could go into an investment account with higher risks and rewards.

Save your tax refund.

You may be tempted to think of a tax refund or stimulus check as extra money for discretionary spending. Instead, consider diverting it toward your emergency fund to give you an added financial cushion.

You probably want to park your emergency fund in a vehicle that can be easily liquidated should a financial need suddenly arise. While storing cash in a savings account may be the safest approach, there are other relatively secure ways to store a part of your emergency fund that offer greater interest-earning potential. These include high-interest savings accounts, money market accounts, and no-penalty certificates of deposit (CDs), which don’t charge savers a fee if they need to pull their money out before the maturity date.

You may want to build an emergency fund before venturing into volatile investment vehicles such as stocks. The latter offer greater long-term growth potential than cash and cash equivalents, but their value can suddenly decrease in the event of an economic downturn, as the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown made vividly clear. Should that be the moment when you need to tap them, you could lose more value. An emergency fund protects your portfolio against that risk.

Helping Employees Save

A number of major employers have introduced programs encouraging emergency savings because of the effects of financial instability on productivity and retirement security. Here’s a sampling of programs from three major companies.

Truist Financial Corp.: Through its Truist Momentum program, the parent of SunTrust and BB&T banks offers $750 to employees who complete an eight-part financial education program, then open and fund an emergency savings account. More than 48,000 employees have graduated as of Aug. 6, 2021, according to the company.

Levi Strauss & Co.: The apparel brand gives hourly employees up to $240 each in matching funds through its Red Tab Foundation when they make qualifying contributions to their savings accounts over a six-month period. Workers also receive a $20 bonus when they link their bank account to the company’s online platform.

Prudential Financial Inc.: Retirement plans administered by Prudential allow employees to divert part of their paycheck toward a savings account, encouraging them to create a financial safety net. This feature serves as after-tax emergency savings and allows employees to withdraw the funds if an emergency arises, while preserving their before-tax retirement contributions.

Example of an Emergency Fund

Here’s a hypothetical example showing how to assemble an emergency fund. Let’s say a married couple has monthly expenses totaling $5,000. This includes the couple’s mortgage payments, food bills, car payments, and other necessary outlays. Using the three-month rule, the couple needs to set aside at least $15,000 (or $30,000 for six months and $40,000 for eight months) to address any unexpected financial burdens.

How much should I have in an emergency fund?

The amount varies according to your living expenses, but the general rule of thumb is to eventually save three to six months of living expenses.

How can I create an emergency fund if I am living paycheck to paycheck?

It won’t be easy, but instead of worrying about your eventual savings amount, decide on a percentage of take-home pay that you can do without. It can be 1% or 2%. The important thing is to save a set amount each payday and not touch it. The money will add up.

What is an emergency fund for?

As simple as the answer seems, it is important to make sure that you can distinguish between what is an emergency and what isn’t. An emergency is an unexpected bill that you can’t pay—not money to go to a movie or for some other nonessential expense.

Our Guide to Investing for Beginners

By

Motley Fool Staff

Aug 19, 2017 at 10:29AM

You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. 
If you're just getting started with investing, here's what you need to know.

If you've decided to start investing -- congratulations! By setting aside some of your money now in investments that could appreciate over time, you'll set yourself up for greater financial security in the future.

Now that you've decided that you want to invest, it's important to devote some time to learning how to invest. With that in mind, here are some basic concepts you should know before you get started.

Why should I invest?

The easy answer to the question is: to create wealth. As a whole, stock investments have historically returned more than 9% per year, on average. If you invested $10,000 at this return rate for 40 years, it would grow to nearly $315,000.

Investing can help you reach your financial goals, such as paying for your children's college education, passing wealth to loved ones, or building a nest egg for your own retirement. There are many potential reasons to invest money.

How much should you invest?

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Including retirement accounts, I generally suggest that you should aim to invest at least 10% of your income. In other words, if you contribute 4% of your salary to your 401(k), it could be a good goal to set aside 6% of your income to invest on your own.

The important thing is that you start as soon as possible, and make it a habit. When I started investing, I had $100 transferred into my brokerage account from every paycheck, automatically. This may not sound like much, but it sure can add up over time. You may be surprised at the long-term impact you can make by investing a seemingly small amount of money while you're young.

The basic types of investments

There are hundreds of things you can invest in, ranging from stocks and bonds to artwork and collectible coins. For our purposes, we're going to focus on investments you can choose in your brokerage account, or in your retirement plan at work. These generally include:

Stocks: Also known as equities, stocks represent partial ownership of one or more companies. If a company does well, the stock can increase in value. Stocks have high return potential over long time periods but tend to be more volatile than other investments.

Bonds: Also known as fixed-income investments, bonds are designed to create a steady stream of income. While bond values are somewhat vulnerable to interest-rate fluctuations, bonds are generally more stable than stocks, but with lower return potential.

Cash: In addition to physical cash, this category includes investments like CDs, money-market accounts, and savings accounts. Cash investments have the lowest risk, but also the lowest return potential.

Mutual funds and ETFs: Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds pool money from many investors and then invest it in an assortment of stocks, bonds, or other investments. For example, an S&P 500 ETF would invest in all 500 stocks that make up the index.

Asset allocation: Stocks vs. bonds vs. cash

Since stocks are highly volatile but have the most return potential, they are more appropriate for younger investors. In contrast, bonds are designed for predictability, making them better for older investors with lower risk tolerance. Cash investments are typically not a good idea unless you have lots of near-term liquidity needs. Determining the appropriate asset allocation for your investment strategy is a critical step to take.

Should I invest actively or passively?

There are two main methods of investing. Active investment refers to picking individual stocks and bonds or buying mutual funds that are actively managed by professionals. In other words, an active investor's goal is to beat the market.

On the other hand, passive investing means simply trying to match the market's performance, generally through funds that track indexes. For example, an S&P 500 ETF (mentioned in the prior section) is a passive investment vehicle.

The question you need to answer is how much time you want to spend on investing. If you have the time and desire to research individual stocks, active investment could be the way to go. If not, there's nothing wrong with passive investing. In fact, billionaire investor Warren Buffett believes that passive investing is the best way to go for many people.

How to choose stocks to invest in

If you choose to invest in individual stocks, the first thing you should understand is the difference between investing and speculating. Investing is a long-term activity, designed to achieve sustained returns that can compound over time. Speculating is akin to gambling -- trying to chase a quick payday.

With that in mind, there are certain types of stocks that make excellent long-term investments, especially for beginners. There are many things to look for in your first stock investments, but just to name a few: You'll want to learn basic ways to value stocks, identify durable competitive advantages, and understand how a business makes money. Of course, our writers at The Motley Fool regularly suggest some good beginner stocks, like these examples.

How to get started

Once you've learned the basics, and you've come up with your game plan, the next step is to open a brokerage account and put your plan into action. Be sure to shop around, as different brokerages charge different fees and offer different features. As a new investor, you'll want a brokerage which offers access to investment research and educational features, in order to help with stock selection and to answer any questions you might have along the way.

9,9,9,"""""""Risk

All investments carry some degree of risk. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds can lose value—even their entire value—if market conditions sour. Even conservative, insured investments, such as certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a bank or credit union, come with inflation risk. That is, they may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.

What Is Risk?

When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to negatively impact your financial welfare. Your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions (market risk). Corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company, can affect the value of your investments (business risk). If you own an international investment, events within that country can affect your investment (political risk and currency risk, to name two). There are other types of risk. How easy or hard it is to cash out of an investment when you need to is called liquidity risk. Another risk factor is tied to how many or how few investments you hold. Generally speaking, the more financial eggs you have in one basket, say all your money in a single stock, the greater risk you take (concentration risk). In short, risk is the possibility that a negative financial outcome that matters to you might occur.

Risk and Reward

The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class typically correlates with the level of return the investment might achieve. The rationale behind this relationship is that investors willing to take on risky investments and potentially lose money should be rewarded for their risk. The tradeoff is that with this higher return comes greater risk.

Time Can Be Your Friend or Foe

Based on historical data, holding a broad portfolio of stocks over an extended period of time (for instance a large-cap portfolio like the S&P 500 over a 20-year period) significantly reduces your chances of losing your principal. However, the historical data should not mislead investors into thinking that there is no risk in investing in stocks over a long period of time. For example, suppose an investor invests $10,000 in a broadly diversified stock portfolio and 19 years later sees that portfolio grow to $20,000. The following year, the investor’s portfolio loses 20 percent of its value, or $4,000, during a market downturn. As a result, at the end of the 20-year period, the investor ends up with a $16,000 portfolio, rather than the $20,000 portfolio she held after 19 years. Money was made—but not as much as if shares were sold the previous year. That’s why stocks are always risky investments, even over the long-term. They don’t get safer the longer you hold them.

Managing Risk

You cannot eliminate investment risk. But two basic investment strategies— asset allocation and diversification—can help manage both systemic risk (risk affecting the economy as a whole) and non-systemic risk (risks that affect a small part of the economy, or even a single company). 

Hedging (buying a security to offset a potential loss on another investment) and insurance products can provide additional ways to manage risk. However, both strategies typically add (often significantly) to the costs of your investment, which can eat away at returns. In addition, hedging typically involves speculative, higher risk activity such as short selling (buying or selling securities you don't own), trading in complex products such as options or investing in illiquid securities.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

Plus you'll have a tax-deferred account that makes saving a cinch through automatic payroll deduction.

Most employers limit you to a preselected list of investment choices.

You can invest in a wide variety of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and individual stocks and bonds.

Pick investments for your IRA

How to get started

Your employer may automatically enroll you in the plan and offer you an easy way to contribute through automatic payroll deduction.

You can open an IRA on your own through almost any bank, brokerage company, insurance firm, or investment company.

Eligible for both? Go for it

The good news is that you don't necessarily have to think IRA versus 401(k). You can save with both as long as you're qualified and heed contribution and income limits.

Learn how an IRA and a 401(k) can work together

If you're eligible to invest in a 401(k) and an IRA, here's an efficient way to do it:

Enroll in your company's 401(k) and contribute at least the amount that your employer will match.

Contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA.

Go back to your 401(k) plan and contribute beyond the match to the annual maximum allowed, if possible.

We recommend following these steps because an IRA offers more flexibility and choice, giving you a greater chance to diversify your assets and reduce your investment risk.

13,13,13,"""How to get a handle on debt | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

There are many steps both big and small to getting a handle on your debt. If you’re unsure where to turn for help or who to trust, you’re not alone. About one in three people have been contacted by a creditor or collector seeking to collect a debt within the past year.

No matter your reasons for changing your financial situation, there are resources available to help you pay off what you owe. If you want to take steps toward any of your financial goals, we’re here to help.

Consider working with a credit counselor. Credit counselors can advise you on ways to manage your money and debt and help you create and follow a budget, which can help you save or pay off a debt. Credit counselors are usually nonprofit organizations.
Then, check on the organization with your state’s attorney general or your local consumer protection agency.

A counselor may:
Offer free educational materials and workshops
Review your budget and come up with a plan to address your money problems
Help you decide which debts to pay first and understand what can happen if you stop making payments
Make an up-front agreement with your creditors to stop collections and not charge you late fees while you are in a debt management program
Develop a debt management plan

Credit counselors usually don’t try to reduce the amount of debt you owe. But they may be able to help lower your payments by having you make payments over a longer period, or they may get your creditors to lower your interest rate.

Beware of debt settlement companies that charge up-front fees in return for promising to settle your debts. Debt settlement companies are different from nonprofit credit counseling organizations. These companies often claim they can make a deal with your creditors to reduce the amount of debt you owe.

Debt settlement companies can be risky; you may end up in more debt than when you started. Not paying your debts while trying to settle them can lower your credit scores, add late fees and interest to your account, or cause creditors or debt collectors to file lawsuits against you.

You should avoid doing business with any debt settlement company that:
Charges any fees before it settles your debts
Tells you to stop communicating with your creditors
Guarantees it can make your debt go away
Tells you it can stop all debt collection calls and lawsuits
Promises you that it can settle all of your debt for a percentage reduction
Promotes a ""new government program"" to bail out personal credit card debt
Guarantees that your unsecured debts can be paid off for pennies on the dollar

Paying off debt can be a long journey. But using this information can get you on track to achieve your financial goals.

They can potentially lower payments by extending the payment period or negotiating lower interest rates with creditors. However, the agency warns against debt settlement companies that require upfront fees and make unrealistic promises about resolving debt.

There are several options for paying off debt, and that can sometimes feel overwhelming. Here’s how to choose a strategy, and some tools and tips that can help you get out of debt.

Assess your debt load

The best way to get out of debt will depend on how much you owe compared with your income.

Weigh DIY payoff methods

Debt snowball and debt avalanche are two ways you can get out of debt yourself by focusing on either the smallest balance or the highest interest rates first. 

Consider debt consolidation to get out of debt faster

Debt consolidation takes your high-interest debt, like credit card balances, and rolls them into one monthly payment, ideally at a lower interest rate. 

Boost debt payoff with budgeting

If you feel like you don’t have enough money to cut down debt, getting clear on your budget may help. 

Lower your bills

Finding ways to reduce your monthly bills can help to free up more money to put toward debt payoff.

Make more money

If you have the ability, making more money even in the short term can boost your debt repayment plan.

What is Market Structure?

Market structure, in economics, refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for goods and services. It is based on the characteristics that influence the behavior and outcomes of companies working in a specific market.

Some of the factors that determine a market structure include the number of buyers and sellers, ability to negotiate, degree of concentration, degree of differentiation of products, and the ease or difficulty of entering and exiting the market.

Summary

Market structure refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods.

The four popular types of market structures include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.

Market structures show the relations between sellers and other sellers, sellers to buyers, or more.

Understanding Market Structures

In economics, market structures can be understood well by closely examining an array of factors or features exhibited by different players. The industry’s buyer structure, the turnover of customers, the extent of product differentiation, the nature of costs of inputs, the number of players in the market, Vertical integration extent in the same industry, the largest player’s market share.

Types of Market Structures

1. Perfect Competition

Perfect competition occurs when there is a large number of small companies competing against each other. They sell similar products (homogeneous), lack price influence over the commodities, and are free to enter or exit the market.

2. Monopolistic Competition

Monopolistic competition refers to an imperfectly competitive market with the traits of both the monopoly and competitive market. Sellers compete among themselves and can differentiate their goods in terms of quality and branding to look different.

3. Oligopoly

An oligopoly market consists of a small number of large companies that sell differentiated or identical products. Since there are few players in the market, their competitive strategies are dependent on each other.

4. Monopoly

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
In a monopoly market, a single company represents the whole industry. It has no competitor, and it is the sole seller of products in the entire market.""","The article discusses the concept of market structure within the field of economics. Market structure refers to the categorization and differentiation of various industries based on the nature and level of competition for goods and services. Key determinants of a market structure include the number of producers and consumers, negotiation power, concentration degree, product differentiation, and the ease of market entry and exit. The article also describes four common types of market structures. These include perfect competition - a market with many small competitors selling similar products; monopolistic competition - a market featuring characteristics of both monopoly and competition; oligopoly - a market dominated by a few large sellers; and monopoly - a market controlled entirely by a single seller. Understanding market structure helps outline relations between sellers, and between sellers and buyers. It's also vital for determining business strategies based on factors like buyer structure, customer turnover, product differentiation, input costs, the industry's player count, vertical integration, and the dominant player's market share.

16,16,16,"""Corporate Finance Fundamentals: Optimal Capital Structure

Optimal Capital Structure — company’s different sources of financing, such as debt, equity, and other financial instruments that allows the company to minimize its overall cost of capital and maximize shareholder value.

The optimal capital structure of a firm is often defined as the proportion of debt and equity that results to the lowest weighted average cost of debt and equity (WACC) of the firm.

As an indicator, if the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is lower than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) then it is advisable to either repurchase shares or pay cash dividends as it indicates that the company’s projects or investments are not generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. In other words, the company is not earning enough from its investments to cover the costs of financing those investments.

WACC Formula

Cost of Equity — the rate of return a shareholder requires for investing equity into business

Cost of Debt — the rate of return a lender requires given the risk of the business

Terminologies;

Debt Capital — raised by borrowing money from various sources, such as banks, bondholders, or other financial institutions. It includes different forms of debt securities. As companies pay interest on the borrowed funds, they are obligated to repay the principal amount within a specified period.

Equity Capital — funds raised by issuing shares of ownership in the company to investors. Equity shareholders have ownership stakes in the company and may be entitled to voting rights and a share in the company’s profits through dividends.

Knowing that the optimal capital structure relies on equity versus debt decision, it is important to take note that excessive debt may increase the risk of default in repayment while DEPENDING EXCESSIVELY ON EQUITY may dilute earnings and value for investors.

Other key factors to consider when determining the optimal capital structure:

Cost of Capital. Debt is usually cheaper than equity due to tax advantages (interest payments are tax-deductible), but too much debt can increase financial risk and interest expenses.

Risk Tolerance. Higher debt levels can magnify financial risk, as debt obligations must be met regardless of the company’s performance.

Industry and Business Characteristics. The industry in which a company operates and its business model influence the optimal capital structure. Some industries may be more debt-heavy, while others may rely more on equity financing.

Flexibility and Growth. If you are expecting rapid growth or significant investment opportunities, prefer a capital structure that provides flexibility in raising additional funds.

Market Conditions. Market conditions, interest rates, and investor preferences also influence the availability and cost of debt and equity financing. This includes industry trends and company’s credit score.

Debt Covenants and Restrictions. Debt covenants and restrictions that come with borrowing can impact the company’s operational and financial flexibility as it may result to operational constraints, capital expenditure limitations, dividend and distribution restrictions, change of control provisions, additional collateral requirements, and costs of borrowing.""

Cost of Equity refers to the expected return of a shareholder for their investment, while Cost of Debt is the return a lender requires given the risk of the business. Debt Capital, obtained from sources like banks, requires repayment of principal and interest over a particular period, while Equity Capital is raised through the issuance of ownership shares, entitling shareholders to voting rights and profit sharing.

Pricing Strategy Under Each Market Structure

Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate.

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand, the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices.

Suppliers can only supply what the consumers can consume at given prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers and therefore operate for as long as production costs fall below revenue.

Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce.

A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products.

Also, since there are many competitors, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices.

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy

Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars.

Generally, an optimal pricing strategy, in the long run, incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors.

Monopoly Market Structure

The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits, if you may, in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.

Question

In monopolistic competitive markets, firms:

are price takers.

set their own prices.

react to the prices set by competitors.

Solution

The correct answer is B.

In monopolistic competition, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.

Since there are many competitors, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices.

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy

Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. Competition is based on product differentiation and services, not on price wars.

An optimal pricing strategy incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors.

Monopoly Market Structure

The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and attract competitors or a change of consumer behavior in favor of substitute products. Raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.

In monopolistic competitive markets, firms set their own prices. In monopolistic competition, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.""

","The text explores various pricing strategies used by firms based on their respective market structures. In a perfectly competitive market, prices are determined by supply and demand, and firms are price takers that can only operate as long as their revenues exceed production costs. In a monopolistic competitive market, firms can set their own prices without significantly impacting the overall market. These firms utilize branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate their products and can remain unaffected by other firms' strategies. In an oligopolistic market, prices are influenced by a small number of competitors, with an optimal pricing strategy considering the reactions of rival firms. Lastly, under monopoly market conditions, a solo firm can set prices due to lack of competition, but must remain cautious to avoid attracting potential competitors or influencing consumers to switch to substitute products.",https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/economics/describe-pricing-strategy-under-each-market-structure/

The Bottom Line

Knowing how to work with the numbers in a company's financial statements is an essential skill for stock investors. The meaningful interpretation and analysis of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements to discern a company's investment qualities is the basis for smart investment choices.

Understanding how to read a company's financial statements is a key skill for any investor wanting to make smart investment choices.

There are four sections to a company's financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, the cash flow statement, and the explanatory notes.

Prudent investors might also want to review a company's 10-K, which is the detailed financial report the company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

An investor should also review non-financial information that could impact a company's return, such as the state of the economy, the quality of the company's management, and the company's competitors.

The financial statements used in investment analysis are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement with additional analysis of a company's shareholders' equity and retained earnings. Although the income statement and the balance sheet typically receive the majority of the attention from investors and analysts, it's important to include in your analysis the often overlooked cash flow statement.

Investors should start by learning how to interpret key figures on a company's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. Those wanting to dig a little deeper may want to consider learning how to analyze reports, such as shareholder’s equity and retained earnings. Investors can find a publicly traded company’s financial statements in its annual report or a 10-K filed with the SEC.

Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are used to prepare financial statements. Both methods are legal in the United States, although GAAP is most commonly used. The main difference between the two methods is that GAAP is more ""rules-based,"" while IFRS is more ""principles-based."" Both have different ways of reporting asset values, depreciation, and inventory, to name a few.

Financial statements only provide a snapshot of a company's financial situation at a specific point in time. They also don't consider non-financial information, such as the health of the broader economy, and other factors, such as income inequality or environmental sustainability. Forward-looking financial statements rely on estimates and assumptions, which may not always be accurate and are subject to change.

Motley Fool senior analyst John Rotonti walks you through the most important financial statements using Chipotle as an example.

In this podcast, Motley Fool senior analyst John Rotonti discusses:

How to understand balance sheets and income statements.

A key metric that can tell you about a company's pricing power.

What you're actually purchasing when you buy a stock.

JJohn Rotonti:

Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin.

Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill, and that was Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti. Today John kicks off a two-part series on the basics of financial statements, including what goes into a balance sheet, how the sale of a burrito at

Chipotle (CMG -0.50%) become shareholder equity, and how financial statements work together.

John Rotonti:

Fools, John Rotonti here. Today we are going to be talking about the three primary financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. 

So gross profit margin is gross profit divided by sales. Now when you're talking about gross profit, you are talking about unit economics, you're also talking about pricing power. What if sales grow a little faster than cost of goods sold grow? You know the answer. That means your gross profit margin is going to increase over time, a sign of pricing power. Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power, and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin. 

Now if you haven't been paying attention, you should start now. Operating income is also called earnings before interest and taxes, E-B-I-T or EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes. That's operating income. From operating income or EBIT, E-B-I-T, we subtract the interest expense on the debt, if the company has any debt. Notice debt holders get paid first. They have a primary claim on a company's cash flows. 

There is a packing order, Fools, to who gets paid. Debt holders, or creditors, they get paid first. We just paid the I, the interest. Remember, we had E-B-I-T. We just pay the interest, so now we are left with E-B-T, earnings before taxes. So who gets paid next? The government in the form of taxes. So debt holders get paid first, and then the government in the form of taxes. 

The other side of the equation, liabilities and shareholders' equity is the sources of funds to buy those assets. Think about it this way. This is going to be exciting. Assets are the uses of the funds. That's the uses of the funds. The company takes the right-hand side of the equation, the liabilities, i.e, debt, and shareholders' equity, i.e, what owners contribute. Those are the two primary sources of funds, and the company takes those to buy or build assets, the left-hand side of the equation, the uses of those funds. 

Chris Hill:

That was part 1. Next Saturday, on part 2, John will dig into the cash flow statement and all the places your money can go before it gets to shareholders.

Financial Analysis

What is Net Present Value?

Net present value is an analysis tool used to decide whether to invest in a capital asset. It is employed as part of the capital budgeting process. A desirable investment is one that yields a positive net present value, which implies that a business will receive excess cash over time as a result of the investment. A negative net present value indicates that a company will lose money on a proposed investment. A negative net present value is usually grounds to terminate an investment that is under consideration.

How to Calculate Net Present Value

Net present value is calculated as the difference between the present value of one or more inbound cash flows and one or more outbound cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology is used to derive present value, using a discount rate as the basis for the discounting. The discount rate is typically based on the cost of capital of the business running the analysis. If the cash flows associated with a proposed investment are expected to be unusually risky, then the discount rate may be increased, thereby reducing the net present value of the associated cash flows.

Advantages of Net Present Value

A key benefit of net present value is that it reduces the cash flows associated with a project to one numeric value, which can be easily compared to the net present values of other projects. The project generating the highest net present value is then selected for investment, while the other projects are assigned a lower priority or rejected.

Disadvantages of Net Present Value

Net present value is not a perfect analysis tool, for it suffers from several problems. First, estimated cash flows rarely match actual results, especially when the original estimates are excessively optimistic. Second, the discount rate used for a capital asset analysis may not be appropriate, given the incremental cost of the capital required to fund a project. Third, an adjustment of the discount rate to account for risk is usually a guess; there is no quantitative derivation of the adjustment. And finally, an investment based on a net present value analysis only looks at the circumstances of a specific investment, rather than the entire system of profit generation; thus, investments using NPV can be sub-optimized.

","Net present value (NPV) is a financial analysis tool utilized broadly in the capital budgeting process to determine whether to invest in a particular capital asset. An investment is desirable if it returns a positive NPV, implying the business will profit over time. Conversely, a negative NPV suggests a loss-generating investment. Calculating NPV involves deducting the present value of outbound cash flows from inbound cash flows, often using a discount rate typically tied to the business's cost of capital. NPV has significant benefits, such as simplifying cash flows to a single numeric value for easy comparisons among projects. However, it also has downsides, including the unpredictability of estimated cash flows, potential mismatch of the used discount rate, and a lack of quantitative risk adjustment. Moreover, NPV analysis often neglects the broader profit-making system, potentially leading to sub-optimization.",https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/net-present-value

24,24,24,"""5 Methods for Capital Budgeting

Capital budgeting is defined as the process used to determine whether capital assets are worth investing in. Capital assets are generally only a small portion of a company’s total assets, but they are usually long-term investments like new equipment, facilities and software upgrades. By incorporating strategically planned capital budgeting into their financial processes, companies can more effectively determine and prioritize which projects, programs and other investment assets could be most financially beneficial in the long-term. As these assets often only generate tangible returns in the long-term, it is important that practicing finance professionals develop an understanding of the five primary methods of capital budgeting, and how they can be utilized to decide the best course of action when firms are planning their next significant capital investment.

Internal Rate of Return

The internal rate of return calculation is used to determine whether a particular investment is worthwhile by assessing the interest that should be yielded over the course of a capital investment. The ideal internal rate of return for a project should be greater than the cost of capital required for the project, as it can be assumed that the project will be a profitable one.

Net Present Value

Net present value (NPV) is used for the same purpose as the internal rate of return, analyzing the projected returns for a potential investment or project. The net present value represents the difference between the current value of money flowing into the project and the current value of money being spent. A positive net present value implies that the earnings generated by a project or investment will exceed the expected costs of the venture and should be pursued.   

Profitability Index

The profitability index is a capital budgeting tool designed to identify the relationship between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was successful. The profitability index employs a ratio that consists of the present value of future cash flows over the initial investment.

Accounting Rate of Return

The accounting rate of return is the projected return that an organization can expect from a proposed capital investment. To discover the accounting rate of return, finance professionals must divide the average profit by the initial investment. 

Payback Period

The payback period is a financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been invested. 

When employing capital budgeting strategies at their respective businesses, finance professionals have a wide array of tools, formulas, and methods available to them. Yet, even with so many tools and options at hand, it’s important that firms remain mindful of their cash flows and capital assets to ensure that their investments prove profitable in the long-term. This way, companies can reap full benefits of capital budgeting by identifying and prioritizing the large investments, which are most likely to have a long-term impact on the company or organization.

25,25,25,"""What is Financial Modeling?

Financial modeling is one of the most highly valued, but thinly understood, skills in financial analysis. The objective of financial modeling is to combine accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.

A financial model is simply a spreadsheet which is usually built in Microsoft Excel, that forecasts a business’s financial performance into the future. The forecast is typically based on the company’s historical performance and assumptions about the future, and requires preparing an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and supporting schedules (know as a three-statement model).

From there, advanced types of models could be built such as discounted cash flow analysis (DCF model), leveraged buyout (LBO), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and sensitivity analysis. 

Key Highlights

Financial modeling combines accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.

The main goal of financial modeling is to accurately project a company’s future financial performance.

Modeling can be useful for valuing companies, determining whether a company should raise capital or grow the business organically or through acquisitions.

What is a Financial Model Used For?

There are many types of financial models with a wide range of uses. The output of a financial model is used for decision-making and performing financial analysis, whether inside or outside of the company. Financial models are used to make decisions about:

Raising capital (debt and/or equity)
Making acquisitions (businesses and/or assets)
Growing the business organically (e.g., opening new stores, entering new markets, etc.)
Selling or divesting assets and business units
Budgeting and forecasting (planning for the years ahead)
Capital allocation (priority of which projects to invest in)
Valuing a business
Financial statement analysis/ratio analysis
Management accounting

What Software is Best for Financial Modeling?

Excel is used because it is the most flexible and customizable spreadsheet tool available. Other software programs may be too rigid and specialized, whereas Excel knowledge is generally more universal.

Who Builds Financial Models?

The main professionals who build financial models are those in investment banking, equity research, corporate development, FP&A, and accounting (due diligence, transaction advisory, valuations, etc).

How Can You Learn Financial Modeling?

The best way to learn financial modeling is to practice. Taking a professional financial modeling training course also offers a solid base understanding of the relevant concepts and skills. 

How Much Accounting Knowledge is Required for Financial Modeling?

In order to build a financial model, you need a solid understanding of accounting fundamentals. You have to know what all the various accounts mean, how to calculate them, and how they’re connected.""

Financial modeling is the application of data analysis to predict business performance, manage assets, and track cash flow. Financial modeling is a vital tool, essential for a business to succeed, whether it is a startup or a Fortune 500 company. A financial modeling course on Udemy can familiarize you with the concepts and strategies vital to business success.

What is financial modeling?

Research analysts, investment bankers, accountants, and entrepreneurs use financial modeling to better understand a company’s performance before making important business decisions. Financial models are generated using MS Excel and can help you accomplish a variety of important tasks such as forecasting business performance, budgeting, asset management, and understanding cash flow. Financial modeling requires a keen sense of numbers and data to prepare the best financial reports for yourself or your clients.

What are some examples of financial models and what are they used for?

There are several different types of financial models used by professionals to help them make the best business decisions. Financial models help professionals make important business decisions about raising capital, forecasting business changes and requirements, or what it will take to grow a business. Some examples of these useful financial models are the discounted cash flow (DCF), a valuation method used to determine the worth of investing in a business; leveraged buyout (LBO), which examines the impact of funding an acquisition with debt; and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a method that analyzes the result of acquiring or merging with another company.

What does an investment banker do?

Investment bankers assist corporations and individual investors by making a variety of critical decisions to best ensure the success of their business and financial growth. Investment bankers work in four areas of the financial services industry: capital markets, advisory, trading and brokerage, and asset management. These banks are not like traditional commercial banks that members of the public use to handle their checking and savings accounts. In fact, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 requires a complete separation between investment banking and commercial banking. Investment bankers provide guidance and expertise to corporate clients seeking to issue an IPO (initial public offering) to raise capital that they could use to expand a business, acquire, or merge with another company.

What are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows?

It also notes what the business owes, or its debt and liabilities.

Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. Put simply, it is the process of monitoring and dealing with the financial risks associated with investing. Risk management essentially occurs when an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment, and then takes the appropriate action (or inaction) to meet their objectives and risk tolerance. 

Investment risk is the deviation from an expected outcome. This deviation is expressed in absolute terms or relative to something else like a market benchmark. 

Every investment involves some degree of risk. It can come close to zero for U.S. T-bills or very high for emerging-market equities or real estate in highly inflationary markets. 

Risk management involves identifying and analyzing where risk exists, and making decisions about how to deal with it. It occurs everywhere in the realm of finance. 

Diligent risk management can help reduce the chance of losses while ensuring that financial goals are met. Inadequate risk management, though, can result in severe consequences for companies, individuals, and the economy. 

The following is a list of some of the most common risk management techniques:

Avoidance: This strategy means choosing the safest assets with little to no risks.

Retention: This strategy involves accepting any risks that come your way and acknowledging that they come with the territory.

Sharing: This technique involves two or more parties taking on an agreed-upon portion of the risk. 

Transferring: Risks can be passed on from one party to another. 

Loss Prevention and Reduction: This strategy means that you find ways to minimize your losses by preventing them from spreading to other areas. 

How much volatility an investor should accept depends entirely on their risk tolerance. For investment professionals, it is based on the tolerance of their investment objectives. 

Behavioral finance highlights the imbalance between people's views of gains and losses.

Companies can manage operational risk by identifying and assessing potential risks, measuring them, and putting controls in place to mitigate them. It's also important that corporations monitor their operations and risk management techniques to see if they are working and make changes whenever necessary.

Risk is an important part of the financial world. The word often brings up feelings of negativity since there is the potential for capital and investment loss. But risk isn't always bad because investments that have more risk often come with the biggest rewards. Knowing what the risks are, how to identify them, and employing suitable risk management techniques can help mitigate losses while you reap the rewards.""""""

29,31,31,"""What Is the Stock Market, What Does It Do, and How Does It Work?

What Is the Stock Market?

The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold. Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces that operate under a defined set of regulations.

Both “stock market” and “stock exchange” are often used interchangeably. Traders in the stock market buy or sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that are part of the overall stock market.

The leading U.S. stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.

Understanding the Stock Market

The stock market allows buyers and sellers of securities to meet, interact, and transact. The markets allow for price discovery for shares of corporations and serve as a barometer for the overall economy. Buyers and sellers are assured of a fair price, high degree of liquidity, and transparency as market participants compete in the open market.

The first stock market was the London Stock Exchange which began in a coffeehouse, where traders met to exchange shares, in 1773.

The first stock exchange in the United States began in Philadelphia in 1790.

A stock market is a regulated and controlled environment. In the United States, the main regulators include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

Though it is called a stock market, other securities, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also traded in the stock market.

How the Stock Market Works

Stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares and other eligible financial instruments with confidence, with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the defined rules as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as primary markets and secondary markets.

As a primary market, the stock market allows companies to issue and sell their shares to the public for the first time through the process of an initial public offering (IPO). This activity helps companies raise necessary capital from investors.

A company divides itself into several shares and sells some of those shares to the public at a price per share.

Using the stock exchanges, investors can also buy and sell securities they already own in what is called the secondary market.

What Are the Functions of a Stock Market?

The stock market ensures price transparency, liquidity, price discovery, and fair dealings in trading activities.

The stock market guarantees all interested market participants have access to data for all buy and sell orders, thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. The market also ensures efficient matching of appropriate buy and sell orders.

How Stock Markets Are Regulated

Most nations have a stock market, and each is regulated by a local financial regulator or monetary authority, or institute. The SEC is the regulatory body charged with overseeing the U.S. stock market.

The SEC is a federal agency that works independently of the government and without political pressure. The mission of the SEC is stated as “protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.”

What Is the Significance of the Stock Market?

The stock market is a component of a free-market economy. It allows companies to raise money by offering stock shares and corporate bonds and allows investors to participate in the financial achievements of the companies, make profits through capital gains, and earn income through dividends. The stock market works as a platform through which savings and investments of individuals are efficiently channeled into productive investment opportunities and add to the capital formation and economic growth of the country.

Who Helps an Investor Trade on the Stock Market?

Stockbrokers act as intermediaries between the stock exchanges and the investors by buying and selling stocks and portfolio managers are professionals who invest portfolios, or collections of securities, for clients.

Investment bankers represent companies in various capacities, such as private companies that want to go public via an IPO or companies that are involved in pending mergers and acquisitions.""

30,32,32,"""What Is a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)?

A grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) is a special type of irrevocable trust that allows the trustmaker/grantor to gamble against the odds. If the trustmaker/grantor plays his cards right, then a significant amount of wealth can move down to the next generation with virtually no estate or gift tax ramifications.

How Does a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) Work?

Here is a general overview of how a GRAT works:

The trustmaker/grantor transfers specific assets into the name of the GRAT and, as the name suggests, retains the right to receive an annual annuity payment for a certain number of years. When the term of the GRAT ends, what is left in the GRAT is distributed to the trust beneficiaries (children or other beneficiaries of the trustmaker/grantor's choice).

The amount of the annuity payment that is required to be paid to the trustmaker/grantor during the term of the GRAT is calculated by using an interest rate the IRS determines monthly called the section 7520 rate. The section 7520 rate for January 2021 is 0.62%. The IRS tracks historical and current section 7520 rates.

The trustmaker/grantor can set the annuity payment so that it will be exactly equal to the section 7520 interest rate, meaning that all of the assets that have been transferred into the GRAT will theoretically be returned to the trustmaker/grantor in the form of the annuity payments and nothing will be left for distribution to the children or other beneficiaries when the GRAT ends. The transfer of assets owned by someone into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of someone else would ordinarily be deemed a gift for federal gift tax purposes, but with a GRAT, since theoretically all of the assets transferred in could come back to the trustmaker/grantor, the value of the gift to the beneficiaries of the GRAT will be at or close to $0. This is called a “zeroed-out GRAT.”

So why would someone set up a trust for the benefit of someone else but get all of the assets back in the form of annuity payments? This is where gambling against the odds comes into the picture. The trustmaker/grantor is really betting on the fact that the assets transferred into the GRAT will appreciate in value above and beyond the section 7520 interest rate. So while the trustmaker/grantor will receive the annuity payments, the beneficiaries of the GRAT will receive the underlying GRAT assets at their value. It's the value of those assets that will appreciate over and above the section 7520 rate.

The Drawbacks of Using a GRAT

Assets that are expected to appreciate greatly in value above can be transferred into a GRAT and in turn, move a significant amount of property down to the beneficiaries of the GRAT when the term ends. There are, however, two downsides to using a GRAT:

The assets transferred into the GRAT could grow at a rate lower than the section 7520 rate. If this is the case, then the trustmaker/grantor will simply receive back the trust property at its depreciated value and will only be out of the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.

The trustmaker/grantor could die during the term of the GRAT. If this is the case, then all of the property transferred into the GRAT would revert back into the estate of the trustmaker/grantor and be taxable for estate tax purposes, and the trustmaker/grantor will also be out the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.

The Bottom Line

GRATs are not for everyone or just any type of asset. The trustmaker/grantor must be willing to take a gamble and bet that the property transferred into the GRAT will outperform the section 7520 interest rate, that the trustmaker/grantor will live to see the end of the term of the GRAT, and that the trustmaker/grantor will not need the gifted property later in life to pay for living expenses or long-term care.

Aside from the drawbacks discussed above, one other important thing to note is that President Obama fought GRATs as an estate reduction tool in his budget proposals throughout his time in office. The budget proposals addressed GRATs on two fronts: (1) GRATs would be required to have a minimum term of 10 years, which increases the chance that the trustmaker/grantor will die during the term of the trust and cause the GRAT assets to be pulled back into the trustmaker/grantor's taxable estate, and (2) zeroed-out GRATs would be eliminated. Instead, transfers into GRATs would be required to have a significant value for gift tax purposes. Both of these changes would have severely limited the effectiveness of GRATs as an estate tax reduction technique.

With the signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) by President Trump on Dec. 22, 2017, GRATs remained the same.""
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
","The text is an in-depth explanation of Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs), a unique type of irrevocable trust that could aid in transferring substantial wealth to the next generation essentially tax-free if executed properly. In a GRAT, the trustmaker transfers specific assets to the trust but retains the right to receive an annual annuity payment for a certain period. At the term's end, the remaining assets in the GRAT are distributed to the trust beneficiaries. The amount of the annuity payment is calculated using an IRS-determined interest rate, which, theoretically, could lead to an annuity payment equal to the interest, leaving nothing for the beneficiaries. This is a gamble, as the trustmaker bets that the assets' value will appreciate above the interest rate. However, potential drawbacks include the possibility of the assets not appreciating above the interest rate, the trustmaker's death during the term of the GRAT (which would revert the assets back into the trustmaker's estate), or the need for the trustmaker to use the assets for future personal expenses. While past political administrations have proposed altering the use of GRATs, they have remained unchanged, as illustrated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed by President Trump in 2017.",https://www.thebalance.com/how-does-the-stock-market-work-3505397

31,37,37,"""Futures in Stock Market: Definition, Example, and How to Trade

What Are Futures?

Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date. Underlying assets include physical commodities and financial instruments. Futures contracts detail the quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. Futures can be used for hedging or trade speculation.

Understanding Futures

Futures allow traders to lock in the price of the underlying asset or commodity. These contracts have expiration dates and set prices that are known upfront. Futures are identified by their expiration month. For example, a December gold futures contract expires in December.

Pros

Investors can use futures contracts to speculate on the direction of the price of an underlying asset.
Companies can hedge the price of their raw materials or products they sell to protect against adverse price movements.
Futures contracts may only require a deposit of a fraction of the contract amount with a broker.

Cons

Investors risk losing more than the initial margin amount since futures use leverage.
Investing in a futures contract might cause a company that hedged to miss out on favorable price movements.
Margin can be a double-edged sword, meaning gains are amplified but so too are losses.

Using Futures

The futures markets typically use high leverage. Leverage means that the trader does not need to put up 100% of the contract's value amount when entering into a trade. Instead, the broker would require an initial margin amount, which consists of a fraction of the total contract value.

Regulation of Futures

The futures markets are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC is a federal agency created by Congress in 1974 to ensure the integrity of futures market pricing, including preventing abusive trading practices, fraud, and regulating brokerage firms engaged in futures trading.

Example of Futures

Let's say a trader wants to speculate on the price of crude oil by entering into a futures contract in May with the expectation that the price will be higher by year-end. The December crude oil futures contract is trading at $50 and the trader buys the contract.

What Are Futures Contracts?

Futures contracts are an investment vehicle that allows the buyer to bet on the future price of a commodity or other security. There are many types of futures contracts available. These may have underlying assets such as oil, stock market indices, currencies, and agricultural products.

Are Futures a Type of Derivative?

Yes, futures contracts are a type of derivative product. They are derivatives because their value is based on the value of an underlying asset, such as oil in the case of crude oil futures. Like many derivatives, futures are a leveraged financial instrument, offering the potential for outsized gains or losses. As such, they are generally considered to be an advanced trading instrument and are usually traded only by experienced investors and institutions.

What Happens if You Hold a Futures Contract Until Expiration?

Oftentimes, traders who hold futures contracts until expiration will settle their position in cash. In other words, the trader will simply pay or receive a cash settlement depending on whether the underlying asset increased or decreased during the investment holding period.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

32,38,38,"""Forex (FX): Definition, How to Trade Currencies, and Examples

What Is Forex (FX)?

Forex (FX) refers to the global electronic marketplace for trading international currencies and currency derivatives. It has no central physical location, yet the forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world by trading volume, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day. Most of the trading is done through banks, brokers, and financial institutions.

The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for holidays. Its name, forex, is a portmanteau of foreign and exchange. It's often abbreviated as fx.

Understanding Forex (FX)

Forex traders use various analysis techniques to find the best entry and exit points for their trades. Forex exists so that large amounts of one currency can be exchanged for the equivalent value in another currency at the current market rate.

Some of these trades occur because financial institutions, companies, or individuals have a business need to exchange one currency for another. For example, an American company may trade U.S. dollars for Japanese yen in order to pay for merchandise that has been ordered from Japan and is payable in yen.

Forex Pairs and Quotes

Currencies being traded are listed in pairs, such as USD/CAD, EUR/USD, or USD/JPY. These represent the U.S. dollar (USD) versus the Canadian dollar (CAD), the Euro (EUR) versus the USD, and the USD versus the Japanese Yen (JPY), respectively.

In the forex market, currencies trade in lots called micro, mini, and standard lots. A micro lot is 1,000 units of a given currency, a mini lot is 10,000, and a standard lot is 100,000.

The forex market is unique for several reasons, the main one being its size. Trading volume is generally very large. The Forex market trades over $5 trillion per day compared to $200 billion for the equities market.

The largest foreign exchange markets are located in major global financial centers including London, New York, Singapore, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and Sydney.

The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, in major financial centers across the globe. This means that you can buy or sell currencies at virtually any hour.

In the past, forex trading was largely limited to governments, large companies, and hedge funds. Now, anyone can trade on forex. Many investment firms, banks, and retail brokers allow individuals to open accounts and trade currencies.

Spot Transactions

A spot market deal is for immediate delivery, which is defined as two business days for most currency pairs. The major exception is the purchase or sale of USD/CAD, which is settled in one business day.

Forex Rollover

Retail traders don't typically want to take delivery of the currencies they buy. They are only interested in profiting from the difference between their transaction prices. Because of this, most retail brokers will automatically roll over their currency positions at 5 p.m. EST each day.

Forex Forward Transactions

Any forex transaction that settles for a date later than spot is considered a forward. The price is calculated by adjusting the spot rate to account for the difference in interest rates between the two currencies. The amount of adjustment is called ""forward points.""

Forex Futures

A forex or currency futures contract is an agreement between two parties to deliver a set amount of currency at a set date, called the expiry, in the future. Futures contracts are traded on an exchange for set values of currency and with set expiry dates.

How Forex Differs From Other Markets

There are some major differences between the way the forex operates and other markets such as the U.S. stock market.

Example of Forex Transactions

Assume a trader believes that the EUR will appreciate against the USD. Another way of thinking of it is that the USD will fall relative to the EUR.

Is Forex Trading for Beginners?

Forex trading can be risky and complex, involving quick decisions due to how fast exchange rates change. It is likely not suited for beginner traders; however, traders can spend time learning forex trading with test trading or with low levels of capital.

How Much Do You Need to Start Trading Forex?

You can start trading Forex with around $100. This will be enough to get you started in buying and selling currencies. It is also a good level for beginners as it isn't a very large amount of capital to lose.

What Are the Risks of Forex Trading?

There are many risks to forex trading. Exchange rates are very volatile, changing often, which could quickly impact a trade. There is also a significant amount of leverage involved in FX, meaning small movements can result in large losses. Additionally, there is transaction risk, interest rate risk, and country risk.

33,40,40,"""What Is Diversification? Definition as Investing Strategy

Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt to limit exposure to any single asset or risk. 

Key Takeaways

Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in an attempt to reduce portfolio risk.
Diversification is most often done by investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrency.
Diversification can also be achieved by purchasing investments in different countries, industries, sizes of companies, or term lengths for income-generating investments.
The quality of diversification in a portfolio is most often measured by analyzing the correlation coefficient of pairs of assets.
Investors can diversify on their own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds.

Understanding Diversification

Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness.

Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the negative performance of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.

Diversification Strategies

As investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. Many of the methods below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio.

Asset Classes

Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Each asset class has a different, unique set of risks and opportunities. 

Industries/Sectors

There are tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. As investors diversify across various industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk.

Market Capitalizations (Large vs. Small)

Investors may want to consider investing across different securities based on the underlying market capitalization of the asset or company. 

Risk Profiles

Across almost every asset class, investors can choose the underlying risk profile of the security. For example, consider fixed-income securities. An investor can choose to buy bonds from the top-rated governments in the world or from nearly defunct private companies raising emergency funds. There are considerable differences between several 10-year bonds based on the issuer, their credit rating, future operational outlook, and existing level of debt.

Maturity Lengths

Specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds, different term lengths impact risk profiles. Generally, the longer the maturity, the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bond's prices due to changes in interest rates. 

Physical Locations (Foreign vs. Domestic)

Investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japan's economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn.

Pros and Cons of Diversification

The primary purpose of diversification is to mitigate risk. By spreading your investment across different asset classes, industries, or maturities, you are less likely to experience market shocks that impact every single one of your investments the same.

However, there are drawbacks to diversification. The more holdings a portfolio has, the more time-consuming it can be to manage—and the more expensive, since buying and selling many different holdings incurs more transaction fees and brokerage commissions. More fundamentally, diversification's spreading-out strategy works both ways, lessening the risk and the reward.

Diversifiable vs. Non-Diversifiable Risk

The idea behind diversification is to minimize (or even eliminate) risk within a portfolio. However, there are certain types of risks you can diversify away, and certain types of risks exist regardless of how you diversify. These types of risks are called unsystematic and systematic risks.

Measuring Diversification

It can become complex and cumbersome to measure how diversified a portfolio is. In reality, it is impossible to calculate the actual degree of diversification; there are simply too many variables to consider across too many assets to truly quantify a single measure of diversification. Still, analysts and portfolio managers use several measurements to get a rough idea of how diversified a portfolio is.

Correlation Coefficient

A correlation coefficient is a statistical measurement that compares the relationship between two variables. This statistical calculation tracks the movement of two assets and whether the assets tend to move in the same direction. 

Standard Deviation

Standard deviation (SD) measures how often and far an outcome occurs away from the mean. For investments, standard deviation measures how far away from an asset's average return other returns fall. Analysts use SD to estimate risk based on return frequency.

Example of Diversification

Imagine an aggressive investor, who can assume a higher risk level, wishes to construct a portfolio composed of Japanese equities, Australian bonds, and cotton futures. They could purchase stakes in the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, the Vanguard Australian Government Bond Index ETF, and the iPath Bloomberg Cotton Subindex Total Return ETN.

34,43,43,"""What Is Asset Allocation and Why Is It Important?

Asset allocation is how investors divide their portfolios among different assets that might include equities, fixed-income assets, and cash and its equivalents. Investors ordinarily aim to balance risks and rewards based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and the investment horizon.

Key Takeaways

Asset allocation is how investors split up their portfolios among different kinds of assets.
The three main asset classes are equities, fixed income, and cash and cash equivalents.
Each asset class has different risks and return potential, so each will behave differently over time.
No simple formula can find the right asset allocation for every individual investor.

Why Is Asset Allocation Important?

There's no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone, but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors make.

Selecting individual securities within an asset class is done only after you decide how to divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. This will largely determine your investment results.

Investors use different asset allocations for distinct goals. Risk tolerance plays a key factor as well. 

Age-Based Asset Allocation

Financial advisors generally recommend holding stocks for five years or longer. Portfolios should generally move to a more conservative asset allocation to help lower risk as individuals approach retirement.

Asset Allocation Through Life-Cycle Funds

Some asset-allocation mutual funds are known as life-cycle or target-date funds. They set out to provide investors with portfolios that address their age, risk appetite, and investment goals with the correlated parts of different asset classes. These funds gradually reduce the risk in their portfolios as they near the target date.

How Do Economic Changes Affect Asset Allocation Strategies?

Economic cycles of growth and contraction greatly affect how you should allocate your assets. During bull markets, investors ordinarily prefer growth-oriented assets like stocks. Alternatively, during downturns or recessions, investors tend to shift toward more conservative investments, which can help preserve capital.

How Does Behavioral Finance View Asset Allocation?

Behavioral finance explores how common cognitive errors might influence our financial choices. For our asset allocation, we might be swayed too much by recent market trends, overconfidence, sunk-cost reasoning, or loss aversion, which can lead to less beneficial allocation choices. 

The Bottom Line

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

There's no universal formula for optimal asset allocation, making it a crucial and personalized step in investment decision-making.

The importance of asset allocation is broadly acknowledged among financial professionals since it directly impacts investment results. Investors may prefer different asset allocations for different goals, influenced by their risk tolerance.

35,46,46,"""Value Investing Definition, How It Works, Strategies, Risks

Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors actively ferret out stocks they think the stock market is underestimating. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term fundamentals. The overreaction offers an opportunity to profit by purchasing stocks at discounted prices.

Understanding Value Investing

The basic concept behind value investing is straightforward: If you know the true value of something, you can save a lot of money when you buy it. Market participants can buy or sell shares without being tethered to an objective price figure. Therefore, stocks, go through periods of higher and lower demand leading to price fluctuations.

Value investing developed from a concept by Columbia Business School professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in 1934 and was popularised in Graham's 1949 book, ""The Intelligent Investor."" 

Intrinsic Value and Value Investing

In the stock market, the equivalent of a stock being cheap or discounted is when its shares are undervalued. Value investors hope to profit from shares they perceive to be deeply discounted.

Investors use various metrics to attempt to find the valuation or intrinsic value of a stock. Intrinsic value is a combination of using financial analysis, such as studying a company's financial performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, profit, and fundamental factors. It includes the company's brand, business model, target market, and competitive advantage.

Margin of Safety

Value investors require some room for error in their estimation of value, and they often set their own ""margin of safety"" based on their particular risk tolerance. The margin of safety principle, one of the keys to successful value investing, is based on the premise that buying stocks at bargain prices gives you a better chance of earning a profit later when you sell them.

Value Investors Believe the Markets Are Not Efficient

Value investors don't believe in the efficient-market hypothesis, which says that stock prices already take all information about a company into account, so their price always reflects their value. Instead, value investors believe that stocks may be over or underpriced for various reasons.

Value Investors Don't Follow the Herd

Value investors don’t follow the herd. They want to own companies that they know have sound principles and sound financials, regardless of what everyone else is saying or doing.

Value Investing Requires Diligence and Patience

Estimating the true intrinsic value of a stock involves some financial analysis but also involves a fair amount of subjectivity. Some investors, who look only at existing financials, don't put much faith in estimating future growth. Other value investors focus primarily on a company's future growth potential and estimated cash flows. Some do both: Noted value investment gurus Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch.

Instead, they believe stocks can be over or underpriced for various reasons.

36,49,49,"""Growth Investing: Overview of the Investing Strategy

What Is Growth Investing?

Growth investing is an investment style and strategy that is focused on increasing an investor's capital. Growth investors typically invest in growth stocks—that is, young or small companies whose earnings are expected to increase at an above-average rate compared to their industry sector or the overall market.

Growth investing is highly attractive to many investors because buying stock in emerging companies can provide impressive returns (as long as the companies are successful). However, such companies are untried, and thus often pose a fairly high risk.

Growth investing may be contrasted with value investing. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.

Understanding Growth Investing

Growth investors typically look for investments in rapidly expanding industries (or even entire markets) where new technologies and services are being developed. Growth investors look for profits through capital appreciation—that is, the gains they'll achieve when they sell their stock (as opposed to dividends they receive while they own it). In fact, most growth-stock companies reinvest their earnings back into the business rather than paying a dividend to their shareholders.

Growth Investing vs. Value Investing

Some consider growth investing and value investing to be diametrically opposed approaches. Value investors seek ""value stocks"" that trade below their intrinsic value or book value, whereas growth investors—while they do consider a company's fundamental worth—tend to ignore standard indicators that might show the stock to be overvalued.

While value investors look for stocks that are trading for less than their intrinsic value today—bargain-hunting so to speak—growth investors focus on the future potential of a company, with much less emphasis on the present stock price. Unlike value investors, growth investors may buy stock in companies that are trading higher than their intrinsic value with the assumption that the intrinsic value will grow and ultimately exceed current valuations.

Some Growth Investing Gurus

One notable name among growth investors is Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., who is known as the father of growth investing. In 1950, Price set up the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, the first mutual fund to be offered by his advisory firm, T. Rowe Price Associates. This flagship fund averaged 15% growth annually for 22 years. Today, T. Rowe Price Group is one of the largest financial services firms in the world.

Philip Fisher also has a notable name in the growth investing field. He outlined his growth investment style in his 1958 book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, the first of many he authored. Emphasizing the importance of research, especially through networking, it remains one of the most popular growth investing primers today.

Peter Lynch, manager of Fidelity Investments' legendary Magellan Fund, pioneered a hybrid model of growth and value investing, which is now commonly referred to as ""growth at a reasonable price"" (GARP) strategy.

Example of a Growth Stock

Amazon Inc. (AMZN) has long been considered a growth stock. In 2021, it remains one of the largest companies in the world and has been for some time. As of Q1 2021, Amazon ranks in the top three U.S. stocks in terms of its market capitalization.

Amazon's stock has historically traded at a high price to earnings (P/E) ratio. Between 2019 and early 2020, the stock's P/E has remained upwards of 70, moderating to around 60 in 2021. Despite the company's size, earnings per share (EPS) growth estimates for the next five years still hover near 30% per year.""

37,60,60,"""Tax Planning: What It Is, How It Works, Examples

What Is Tax Planning?

Tax planning is the analysis of a financial situation or plan to ensure that all elements work together to allow you to pay the lowest taxes possible. A plan that minimizes how much you pay in taxes is referred to as tax efficient. Tax planning should be an essential part of an individual investor's financial plan. Reduction of tax liability and maximizing the ability to contribute to retirement plans are crucial for success.

Key Takeaways

Tax planning is the analysis of a financial situation or plan to ensure that all elements work together to allow you to pay the lowest taxes possible.

Considerations of tax planning include the timing of income, size, the timing of purchases, and planning for expenditures.

Tax planning strategies can include saving for retirement in an IRA or engaging in tax gain-loss harvesting.

Understanding Tax Planning

Tax planning covers several considerations. Considerations include timing of income, size, and timing of purchases, and planning for other expenditures. Also, the selection of investments and types of retirement plans must complement the tax filing status and deductions to create the best possible outcome.

Retirement Saving Strategies

Saving via a retirement plan is a popular way to efficiently reduce taxes. Contributing money to a traditional IRA can minimize gross income by the amount contributed. For 2022, if meeting all qualifications, a filer under age 50 can contribute a maximum of $6,000 to their IRA with an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000 if age 50 or older.

That number rises to $6,500 in 2023, with the catch-up contribution holding steady at $1,000.

For example, if a 52-year-old male with an annual income of $50,000 who made a $7,000 contribution to a traditional IRA has an adjusted gross income of $43,000, the $7,000 contribution would grow tax-deferred until retirement.

There are several other retirement plans that an individual may use to help reduce tax liability.

401(k) plans are popular with larger companies that have many employees. Participants in the plan can defer income from their paycheck directly into the company’s 401(k) plan. The greatest difference is that the contribution limit dollar amount is much higher than that of an IRA.

Using the same example as above, the 52-year-old could contribute up to $27,000 into their 401(k) in 2022 (rising to $30,000 in 2023). That's because in 2022, if a person is under age 50, the salary contribution can be up to $20,500 ($22,500 for 2023), or up to $27,000 ($30,000 for 2022) if age 50 or older due to the allowed additional $6,500 catch-up contribution.

The catch-up contribution for 2023 rises to $7,500.

Tax Planning vs. Tax Gain-Loss Harvesting

Tax gain-loss harvesting is another form of tax planning or management relating to investments. It is helpful because it can use a portfolio's losses to offset overall capital gains. According to the IRS, short and long-term capital losses must first be used to offset capital gains of the same type. In other words, long-term losses offset long-term gains before offsetting short-term gains. Short-term capital gains, or earnings from assets owned for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income rates.

As of 2022, long-term capital gains are taxed as follows:


0% for single filers whose income is no more than $41,675 ($83,350 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $55,800 in the case of an individual who is head of household, or $41,675 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

15% tax for single filers whose income is between $41,676 and $459,750 ($517,200 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $488,500 in the case of an individual who is the head of a household, or $258,600 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

20% tax for those whose income is higher than listed for the 15% tax

In 2023, long-term capital gain limits will be increasing to the following:

0% for single filers whose income is no more than $44,625 ($89,250 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $59,750 in the case of an individual who is head of household, $44,625 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

15% tax for single filers whose income is between $44,626 and $492,300 ($553,850 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $523,050 in the case of an individual who is the head of a household, or $276,900 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

20% tax for those whose income is higher than that listed for the 15% tax

For example, if a single investor whose income was $100,000 had $10,000 in long-term capital gains, there would be a tax liability of $1,500. If the same investor sold underperforming investments carrying $10,000 in long-term capital losses, the losses would offset the gains, resulting in a tax liability of 0. If the same losing investment were brought back, then a minimum of 30 days would have to pass to avoid incurring a wash sale.

According to the Internal Revenue Service, ""If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on (line 21) of Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).

For example, if the 52-year-old investor had $3,000 in net capital losses for the year, the $50,000 income will be adjusted to $47,000. The remaining capital losses can be carried over with no expiration to offset future capital gains.""","The article delves into the concept of tax planning, defining it as the analysis of one's financial situation in order to minimize tax liability and maximize contributions to retirement plans. The plan can involve a range of factors, including income, purchase timings, and other expenditures. It discusses different strategies for tax planning, like saving for retirement in an IRA or engaging in tax gain-loss harvesting. For example, contributing to a traditional IRA can minimise one's gross income by the amount contributed, with the maximum contribution rising to $6,500 in 2023. Alternatively, 401(k) plans offer higher contribution limits. The article also discusses tax gain-loss harvesting, which involves offsetting capital gains with a portfolio's losses. By using this method, long-term and short-term capital losses can be utilized to offset capital gains, which can reduce tax liability. It also touches upon the changes to long-term capital gains taxes in 2023. The tax rates vary based on an individual's income level.

What is Behavioral Finance?

Behavioral finance is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It also includes the subsequent effects on the markets. It focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases.

Traditional Financial Theory

Traditional finance includes the following beliefs:

- Both the market and investors are perfectly rational
- Investors truly care about utilitarian characteristics
- Investors have perfect self-control
- They are not confused by cognitive errors or information processing errors

Behavioral Finance Theory

Traits of behavioral finance are:

- Investors are treated as “normal” not “rational”
- They actually have limits to their self-control
- Investors are influenced by their own biases
- Investors make cognitive errors that can lead to wrong decisions

Decision-Making Errors and Biases

Behavioral finance views investors as “normal” but being subject to decision-making biases and errors. We can break down the decision-making biases and errors into at least four buckets.

- Self-Deception: The concept of self-deception is a limit to the way we learn.
- Heuristic Simplification: Heuristic simplification refers to information-processing errors.
- Emotion: Our current mood may take our decision-making off track from rational thinking.
- Social Influence: How our decision-making is influenced by others.

Top 10 Biases in Behavioral Finance

Common biases include:

- Overconfidence and illusion of control
- Self Attribution Bias
- Hindsight Bias
- Confirmation Bias
- The Narrative Fallacy
- Representative Bias
- Framing Bias
- Anchoring Bias
- Loss Aversion
- Herding Mentality

Overcoming Behavioral Finance Issues

There are ways to overcome negative behavioral tendencies in relation to investing. Here are some strategies you can use to guard against biases.

- Focus on the Process: Relying on reflexive decision-making makes us more prone to deceptive biases and emotional and social influences.
- Prepare, Plan and Pre-Commit: Behavioral finance teaches us to invest by preparing, by planning, and by making sure we pre-commit.""""""

39,65,65,"""Prospect Theory - Overview, Phases, and Features

What is Prospect Theory?

Prospect theory is a psychology theory that describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and uncertainty. It holds that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains.

Given the choice of equal probabilities, most people would choose to retain the wealth that they already have, rather than risk the chance to increase their current wealth. People are usually averse to the possibility of losing, such that they would rather avoid a loss rather than take a risk to make an equivalent gain.

History of Prospect Theory

The prospect theory is sometimes referred to as the loss-aversion theory. The theory was introduced by two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman, and Amos Tversky, to describe how humans make decisions when presented with several choices.

The theory was contained in the paper “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk” that was published in the “Econometrica” journal in 1979. Since it was developed, the prospect theory’s been used in various disciplines. It is used to evaluate various aspects of political decision-making in international relations.

Phases of Prospect Theory

The theory describes the decision-making process in two phases, which include:

1. Editing phase
The editing phase refers to how people involved in decision-making characterize the options for choice or the framing effects. The effects explain how a person’s choice is influenced by the wording, order, or method in which the choices are presented.

2. Evaluation phase
In the evaluation phase, people tend to behave as if they would make a decision based on the potential outcomes and choose the option with a higher utility. The evaluation phase comprises two indices, i.e., the value function and the weighting function, which are used to compare the prospects.

Features of the Prospect Theory

The prospects theory comes with the following characteristics:

1. Certainty
When presented with several options to choose from, humans show a strong preference for the option with certainty.

2. Small probabilities
People tend to discount very small probabilities even if there is a possibility of losing all their wealth.

3. Relative positioning
Relative positioning means that people tend to focus less on their final income or wealth, and more on the relative gains or losses that they will get.

4. Loss aversion
People tend to give more weight to losses rather than gains made by taking a certain option.

Criticism of Prospect Theory

One of the criticisms of the prospects theory is that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about. The criticism comes from other psychologists who notes that factors such as human emotional and affective responses that are important in the decision-making process are absent in the model.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The theory is also criticized for the inadequate framing theory that explains why actors generate the frames they use. Decision-makers often need to deal with competing frames across various issues.""","The article provides an extensive overview of Prospect Theory, a psychological theory that explains people’s decision-making processes under circumstances characterized by risk, probability, and uncertainty. Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky and published in 1979, the theory props up that individuals generally prefer maintaining their current wealth over risking it for potential gains because they are averse to losses. This theory, often referred to as the loss-aversion theory, is divided into two key phases - 'Editing' and 'Evaluation'. The Editing phase is concerned with how options are presented or characterized, while the Evaluation phase involves a decision being made based on potential outcomes, using the value function and the weighting function. Key features of the theory include a preference for certainty, discounting of very small probabilities, relative positioning where relative gains or losses are focused on, and loss aversion. Despite its numerous applications in different disciplines, the theory has been criticized for the absence of psychological explanations for the processes it describes, and allegedly inadequate framing theory.",https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/prospect-theory/

42,72,72,"""Dodd-Frank Act: What It Does, Major Components, and Criticisms

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress in response to financial industry behavior that led to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. It sought to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers.

Named for sponsors Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the act contains numerous provisions, spelled out over 848 pages, that were to be implemented over a period of several years.

The Dodd-Frank Act targeted financial system sectors that were believed to have caused the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The institutions considered responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis included banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies.

Critics of the law argue that the regulatory burdens it imposes could make U.S. firms less competitive than their foreign counterparts. 

In 2018, Congress passed a new law that rolled back some of Dodd-Frank’s restrictions.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a massive piece of financial reform legislation that was passed in 2010, during the Obama administration. It established a number of new government agencies tasked with overseeing the various components of the law and, by extension, various aspects of the financial system.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2007–2008. 

Components of the Dodd-Frank Act:

Financial Stability: Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Orderly Liquidation Authority monitor the financial stability of major financial firms whose failure could have a serious negative impact on the U.S. economy.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) prevents predatory mortgage lending and helps consumers understand the terms of a mortgage before agreeing to it.

Volcker Rule: The Volcker Rule restricts how banks can invest, limits speculative trading, and eliminates proprietary trading. 

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Office of Credit Ratings: Dodd-Frank established the SEC Office of Credit Ratings because credit rating agencies had been accused of giving out misleading favorable investment ratings in the lead-up to the financial crisis.

Whistleblower Program: Dodd-Frank also strengthened and expanded the existing whistleblower program.

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act rolled back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It was signed into law by then-President Trump on May 24, 2018. 

Proponents of Dodd-Frank believed that the law would prevent the economy from experiencing a crisis like that of 2007–2008 and protect consumers from many of the abuses that contributed to the crisis.

Detractors, however, have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts.

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, was a direct response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing government bailouts. This law established a wide range of reforms throughout the entire financial system, with the purpose of preventing a repeat of the 2007–2008 crisis and the need for further government bailouts. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also included additional protections for consumers.

43,73,73,"""Solvency II

Solvency II is the prudential regime for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the EU. It entered into force in January 2016. Solvency II sets out requirements applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies in the EU with the aim to ensure the

adequate protection of policyholders and beneficiaries. It has a risk-based approach that enables to assess the “overall solvency” of insurance and reinsurance undertakings through quantitative and qualitative measures.

The Solvency II regulatory framework is built on a three-pillar structure: 
Pillar I sets the quantitative requirements i.e. the assets and liabilities valuation and capital requirements.
Pillar II sets the qualitative requirements, including governance and risk management of the undertakings and the Own Risk and solvency Assessment (ORSA).
Pillar III sets the supervisory reporting and public disclosure. 
The three pillars form a coherent approach that allow to understand and to manage risks across the sector.

The key features of the Solvency II regulatory framework are: 
Market consistent: assets and liabilities shall be valued at the amount for which they can be exchanged, transferred or settled in the market.
Risk-based:  Higher risks will lead to a higher capital requirement to cover for unexpected losses.
Proportionate: regulatory requirements shall be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to the business of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings.
Group supervision: supervisors shall increase coordination and exchange of information in colleges of supervisors to improve cross-border supervision of insurance and reinsurance groups.

The Solvency II legislation is implemented on three levels. 
Level 1: Solvency II Directive -
Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) lays down the general principles.
Level 2: the Delegated Regulation and Implementing technical standards -
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) does not require any additional implementation.
Level 3: Guidelines -
EIOPA issues guidelines and recommendations to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices and to ensure common and consistent application of Union law.

EOIPA provided its technical advice to the European Commission on 17 December 2020 for Solvency II review.

It was deemed necessary to revise the existing regulation, which followed a lack of an economic risk-based approach and differences in implementation across the EU. The discussions took particular importance in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as it identified the need for a modern risk management, and considering wider implications for financial stability. 
In 2009, the Solvency II Directive was adopted in November 2009 and was amended by Directive 2014/51/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014.
