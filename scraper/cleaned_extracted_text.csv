0,0,"""Economic Indicator: Definition and How to Interpret
An economic indicator is a piece of economic data, usually of macroeconomic scale, that is used by analysts to interpret current or future investment possibilities. These indicators also help to judge the overall health of an economy. Economic indicators can be anything the investor chooses, but specific pieces of data released by the government and non-profit organizations have become widely followed. Such indicators include but aren't limited to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment figures.

An economic indicator is a macroeconomic measurement used to understand current and future economic activity and opportunity.

Types of Economic Indicators
Economic indicators can be divided into categories or groups.
Leading Indicators
Leading indicators, such as the yield curve, consumer durables, net business formations, and share prices, are used to predict the future movements of an economy.
Coincident Indicators
Coincident indicators, which include things as GDP, employment levels, and retail sales, are seen with the occurrence of specific economic activities.
Lagging Indicators
Lagging indicators, such as gross national product (GNP), CPI, unemployment rates, and interest rates, are only seen after a specific economic activity occurs.

Interpreting Economic Indicators
An economic indicator is only useful if one interprets it correctly. History has shown strong correlations between economic growth, as measured by GDP, and corporate profit growth.

The Stock Market As an Indicator
Leading indicators forecast where an economy is headed. One of the top leading indicators is the stock market itself. A strong market may suggest that earnings estimates are up, which may suggest overall economic activity is up.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Economic Indicators
Pros of Economic Indicators
Economic indicators rely on data to substantiate predictions of what is to come in the future. When analyzed correctly, investors can capitalize on data to make successful trades or correctly assess future market conditions.
Cons of Economic Indicators
The downside to economic indicators is that they rely on some degree of forecasting.

What Is the Most Important Economic Indicator?
For many, a country's GDP usually represents the best overall picture of a country's economic health.

Is Inflation an Economic Indicator?
Yes, inflation is a lagging indicator that is reported after a rise in prices has occurred.

The Bottom Line
Economic indicators are leading, coincident, or lagging figures that indicate broad conditions. Economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, or certain prices inform economics, companies, and investors of not only where the economy is today but perhaps where the economy may be headed. Economic indicators can be used to guide government policy or set investment strategies.""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_indicator.asp

Economic Indicators You Should Know for Investment
By Ryan Barnes, Updated April 18, 2023, Reviewed by Margaret James, Fact-checked by Suzanne Kvilhaug. 
Economic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Metrics such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and written reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. Policymakers, notable those at the Federal Reserve, use indicators to determine where the economy is going and how fast it's getting there. 
While these reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw, there's valuable information in these data releases. These indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, beneficial to individual investors. 
What Is an Economic Indicator?
An indicator can be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. With the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various economic conditions. 
Use in Tandem, Use in Context
Several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. The savvy investor will look up and down the supply chain to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release. 
Personalizing Your Research
Some people may prefer to understand specific indicators really well and make investment plays based on these analyses. Others may wish to understand the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. 
Inflation Indicators: Keeping a Watchful Eye
Many investors, especially those who invest in fixed-income securities, are concerned about inflation. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure such as the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Economic Output: Stock Investors Inquire Within
The gross domestic product (GDP) is significant, especially to equity investors focused on corporate profit growth. Many people will follow the monthly indicators that can shed some light on the quarterly GDP report. Metrics such as wholesale inventories, the Beige Book, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), and the labor report all shed light on the economy.  
Mark Your Calendar
Sometimes indicators take on a more valuable role because they contain very timely data. The Institute for Supply Management's PMI report, for instance, is typically released on the first business day of every month. 
The Bottom Line
By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the stock market and the economy where their dollars are invested, and they can also be better prepared to revisit an investment thesis when the timing is right. While there is no one ""magic indicator"" that can dictate whether to buy or sell, using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter portfolio management.""",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/economic_indicators.asp

What Are Financial Markets?
Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs, including the stock market, bond market, forex market, and derivatives market. Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies.
Key Takeaways
Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs.
There are many kinds of financial markets, including (but not limited to) forex, money, stock, and bond markets.
Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate.
Understanding the Financial Markets
Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of capitalist economies by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs. The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings. Financial markets create securities products that provide a return for those with excess funds (investors/lenders) and make these funds available to those needing additional money (borrowers).
The stock market is a financial market that enables investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies.
Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value.
Types of Financial Markets
There are several different types of markets. Stock Markets, Over-the-Counter Markets, Bond Markets, Money Markets, Derivatives Markets, Forex Market, Commodities Markets, Cryptocurrency Markets.
Stock Markets
Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets.
Over-the-Counter Markets
An over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized market where market participants trade securities directly. 
Bond Markets
A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate.
Money Markets
Typically, the money markets trade in products with highly liquid short-term maturities and are characterized by a high degree of safety.
Derivatives Markets
A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). 
Forex Market
The forex (foreign exchange) market is where participants can buy, sell, hedge, and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs.
Commodities Markets
Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities.
Cryptocurrency Markets
Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online crypto exchanges. 
Examples of Financial Markets
The above sections make clear that the ""financial markets"" are broad in scope and scale. Stock Markets and IPOs, OTC Derivatives and the 2008 Financial Crisis: MBS and CDOs.
What Are the Different Types of Financial Markets?
Some examples of financial markets and their roles include the stock market, the bond market, forex, commodities, and the real estate market, among others.
How Do Financial Markets Work?
Despite covering many different asset classes and having various structures and regulations, all financial markets work essentially by bringing together buyers and sellers in some asset or contract and allowing them to trade with one another. 
What Are the Main Functions of Financial Markets?
Financial markets exist for several reasons, but the most fundamental function is to allow for the efficient allocation of capital and assets in a financial economy.
The Bottom Line
Financial markets provide liquidity, capital, and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability.
Many players make markets an essential part of the economy—firms use stock and bond markets to raise capital from investors. Speculators look to various asset classes to make directional bets on future prices.

5,5,"""The 50/30/20 Budget Rule Explained With Examples
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren popularized the 50/20/30 budget rule in her book, All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan. The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings. This intuitive and straightforward rule can help you draw up a reasonable budget that you can stick to over time in order to meet your financial goals.

Key Takeaways 

The rule states that you should spend up to 50% of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do. The remaining half should be split up between 20% savings and debt repayment and 30% to everything else that you might want. The rule is a template that is intended to help individuals manage their money and save for emergencies and retirement. The purpose of the 50/30/20 rule is to balance paying for necessities while being mindful of long-term savings and retirement. The 50/30/20 rule can be simplified by setting up automatic deposits, using automatic payments, and tracking changes in income.

50%: Needs 

Needs are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for survival. Half of your after-tax income should be all that you need to cover your needs and obligations. If you are spending more than that on your needs, you will have to either cut down on wants or try to downsize your lifestyle, perhaps to a smaller home or more modest car. Maybe carpooling or taking public transportation to work is a solution, or cooking at home more often. Examples of needs"" include but aren't limited to:
Rent or mortgage payments, Car payments, Groceries, Insurance and health care, Minimum debt payments, Utilities.

30%: Wants 

Wants are all the things you spend money on that are not absolutely essential. Anything in the ""wants"" bucket is optional if you boil it down. You can work out at home instead of going to the gym, cook instead of eating out, or watch sports on TV instead of getting tickets to the game. This category also includes those upgrade decisions you make, such as choosing a costlier steak instead of a less expensive hamburger, buying a Mercedes instead of a more economical Honda, or choosing between watching television using an antenna for free or spending money to watch cable TV. Basically, wants are all those little extras you spend money on that make life more enjoyable and entertaining. In general, examples of ""wants"" include but aren't limited to:
New unnecessary clothes or accessories like handbags or jewelry, Tickets to sporting events, Vacations or other non-essential travel, The latest electronic gadget (especially an upgrade over a fully functioning prior model), Ultra-high-speed Internet beyond your streaming needs.

20%: Savings 

Finally, try to allocate 20% of your net income to savings and investments. You should have at least three months of emergency savings on hand in case you lose your job or an unforeseen event occurs. After that, focus on retirement and meeting other financial goals down the road. Examples of savings could include:
Creating an emergency fund, Making IRA contributions to a mutual fund account, Investing in the stock market, Setting aside funds to buy physical property for long-term holding, Making debt repayments beyond minimum payments. If emergency funds are ever used, the first allocation of additional income should be to replenish the emergency fund account.

Importance of Savings

Americans are notoriously bad at saving, and the nation has extremely high levels of debt. As of August 2023, the average personal savings rate for individuals in the United States was just 3.9%. The 50-20-30 rule is intended to help individuals manage their after-tax income, primarily to have funds on hand for emergencies and savings for retirement. Every household should prioritize creating an emergency fund in case of job losses, unexpected medical expenses, or any other unforeseen monetary cost. If an emergency fund is used, then a household should focus on replenishing it. Saving for retirement is also a critical step as individuals are living longer. Calculating how much you will need for retirement and working towards that goal, beginning at a young age will ensure a comfortable retirement.

Benefits of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule 

The 50/30/20 rule can guide individuals to financial prosperity in a number of different ways. Potential benefits from these guidelines include:

Ease of Use: The 50/30/20 rule offers a straightforward framework for budgeting, making it simple to comprehend and apply. You may distribute your income immediately without the need for intricate calculations. This makes it so even the least financially-savvy person can still adhere to these rules.

Enact Financial Balance: By using a budget, you may manage your money in a balanced way. You may make sure that your necessary costs are covered, that you have money for discretionary spending, and that you're actively saving for the future. In this way, you'll be able to save for the future, save for current needs, and still have a little fun with finances.

Prioritize Vital Expenses: You can make sure that you cover your fundamental needs without going over budget or taking on too much debt by giving these basics top priority. As these rules stipulate that half of your budget goes towards needs, this plan makes sure your essentials are more likely to be met.

Emphasize Saving Goals: By allocating 20% of your income to savings, you can set up an emergency fund, prepare for retirement, pay off debt, invest, or pursue other financial goals. By consistently saving this amount, you establish sound financial practices and build a safety net for unforeseen costs or future goals.

Promote Long-Term Financial Security: Using these rules, you give your financial future priority by continuously setting aside 20% of your salary. This expenditure on savings can help you accumulate money, meet long-term financial objectives, and give yourself and your family a sense of security as you approach retirement in either the short-term or long-term timeframe.

The idea behind the 50/30/20 rule is that anyone can use these proportions, regardless of their income. However, be mindful how those with lower income or those living in higher cost of living areas may need to adjust these percentages.

How to Adopt the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

No single way of tracking to a budget will work for everyone. However, here are some high-level tips on adopting a 50/30/20 budget relevant to all individuals.

Track Your Expenses 

To better understand your spending habits, start by keeping track of your expenses for a month or two. Analyze your spending to determine how well it adheres to the 50/30/20 breakdown by classifying it into needs, wants, and savings. This will set the groundwork for better understanding how far off from budget you will be starting off at. Also, the only way you'll know you're being successful at adhering to this budget is by tracking your actual spend. Most often, this can be done fairly easy using spreadsheet solutions such as Microsoft Excel.

Understanding Your Income

The basis of the 50/30/20 budget is rooted in understanding what your income is. Take caution that your gross income may be vastly different from your net income as Federal income taxes reduce what you'll take home. By understanding what you earn and what actually hits your bank account each pay period, you'll be better positioned to establish the correct budget amounts for the three categories.

Identify Your Critical Costs 

This includes expenses such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, transportation expenses, insurance premiums, and debt repayments. These costs are non-negotiable, and these must be expenses necessary for your daily living. Because these expenses may take up the largest portion of your budget, it's important to be most mindful with this group. In addition, these expenses must be incurred, so you likely have the least amount of flexibility once they are committed to. For example, locking into a rental agreement may require a six-month or 12-month requirement.

Automate Your Savings 

By automating the process, saving will be simpler. Set up monthly automated payments from your checking account to your investment or savings accounts. This guarantees that your funds increase steadily without requiring manual labor. This may also make it easier to regularly review your budget to make sure it is in line with your lifestyle and financial objectives as there is less of a burden to administratively manage your savings.

Maintain Consistency 

Adopting the 50/30/20 budget guideline successfully requires maintaining consistency. Over time, stick to your spending strategy and resisted the want to go over budget or depart from your percentage allocations. Like any other form of budget, this plan is often most successful when there are clear guidelines that can leveraged every month. Be mindful to reset your spending limits each month, and strive to maintain consistency from one period to the next.

Example of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

Imagine a person recently graduated from college and started her first full-time job. She wants to develop good financial habits from the beginning and has heard about the 50/30/20 budget rule. Eager to take control of her finances, she decides to set up a 50/30/20 budget.

To understand her spending patterns, the person starts tracking her expenses for a month. She uses a budgeting app that categorizes her expenses automatically into needs, wants, and savings. The person calculates her monthly after-tax income, which amounts to $3,500. This will be her basis for allocating her budget according to the 50/30/20 rule.

After analyzing her tracked expenses, the person realizes that her essential expenses like rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and student loan payments add up to approximately $1,750 per month. She allocates exactly 50% of her income, which is $1,750, to cover these needs. The person then allocates $1,050 to discretionary items and $700 each month to retirement and savings. The person sets up an automatic transfer from her checking account to her savings account on her payday.

Six months later, the person is promoted. Because the person's income has changed, she reevaluates each budget amount. In addition, the person reviews her budget and adjusts as needed. She also realizes that her transportation expenses are higher than expected, so she decides to start carpooling with a colleague to reduce costs.

The person remains disciplined and consistent with her budgeting practice. She prioritizes financial well-being and regularly evaluates her progress toward her goals. As she progresses in her career, she continues to adjust her budget to reflect changes in her income and priorities. In the long run, the person has taken steps to not only have their needs met but have sufficient funds available for their future.

FAQs

The Bottom Line

Saving is difficult, and life often throws unexpected expenses at us. By following the 50-20-30 rule, individuals have a plan with how they should manage their after-tax income. If they find that their expenditures on wants are more than 30%, they can find ways to reduce those expenses that will help direct funds to more important areas such as emergency money and retirement.
Life should be enjoyed, and it is not recommended to live like a Spartan, but having a plan and sticking to it will allow you to cover your expenses, save for retirement, all at the same time doing the activities that make you happy.""",https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp

What Is an Emergency Fund?
The term “emergency fund” refers to money stashed away that people can use in times of
financial distress.
Assets in an emergency fund tend to be cash or other highly
liquid assets. This reduces the need to either draw from high-interest debt options, such as
credit cards,
or undermine your future security by tapping into
retirement funds.
Key Takeaways
An emergency fund is a financial safety net for future mishaps and/or unexpected expenses.
Emergency funds should typically have three to six months’ worth of expenses, although the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown has led some experts to suggest up to one year’s worth.
Individuals should keep their emergency funds in accounts that are easily accessible and easily liquidated.
Savers can use tax refunds and other windfalls to build up their funds.
Some employers have established programs to encourage emergency fund saving.
Understanding Emergency Funds
You establish an emergency fund when you put away money that is intended to be used during times of financial hardship. This includes the loss of your job, a debilitating illness, or a major repair to your home or car—not to mention the kind of major economic crisis and lockdown
that happened in 2020.
Research shows that many Americans are well short of the recommended range. In fact, a 2020 survey by the
Federal Reserve
found that more than one-fourth of Americans lacked the ability to cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalents. Among unemployed workers, that figure rose to 45%.
How to Build an Emergency Fund
Starting early is the key to setting up an emergency fund, because it helps you build up a comfortable cushion against unexpected emergencies later in life.
Getting a start on emergency funds is relatively easy. Here are two simple ways to begin saving for one.
Set aside a comfortable amount from your salary each month.
Calculate your living expenses for the desired period, and make that your target for an emergency fund.
Save your tax refund.
You may want to park your emergency fund in a vehicle that can be easily
liquidated
should a financial need suddenly arise.
Helping Employees Save
A number of major employers have introduced programs encouraging emergency savings because of the effects of financial instability on
productivity
and retirement security.

Example of an Emergency Fund
Here’s a hypothetical example showing how to assemble an emergency fund. Let’s say a married couple has monthly expenses totaling $5,000. This includes the couple’s mortgage payments, food bills, car payments, and other necessary outlays. Using the three-month rule, the couple needs to set aside at least $15,000 (or $30,000 for six months and $40,000 for eight months) to address any unexpected financial burdens.
How much should I have in an emergency fund?
The amount varies according to your living expenses, but the general rule of thumb is to eventually save three to six months of living expenses.
How can I create an emergency fund if I am living paycheck to paycheck?
It won’t be easy, but instead of worrying about your eventual savings amount, decide on a percentage of take-home pay that you can do without. It can be 1% or 2%. The important thing is to save a set amount each payday and not touch it. The money will add up.
What is an emergency fund for?
An emergency is an unexpected bill that you can’t pay—not money to go to a movie or for some other nonessential expense.

Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to negatively impact your financial welfare. Your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions (market risk). Corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company, can affect the value of your investments (business risk). If you own an international investment, events within that country can affect your investment. There are other types of risk. Liquidity risk is how easy or hard it is to cash out of an investment when you need to. Another risk factor is tied to how many or how few investments you hold. Generally speaking, the more financial eggs you have in one basket, say all your money in a single stock, the greater risk you take (concentration risk). In short, risk is the possibility that a negative financial outcome that matters to you might occur.

Risk and Reward
The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class typically correlates with the level of return the investment might achieve. Investors willing to take on risky investments and potentially lose money should be rewarded for their risk. Higher risk might lead to higher return. Stocks have historically provided a higher return than bonds and cash investments (albeit, at a higher level of risk), but it's not always the case that stocks outperform bonds or that bonds are always lower risk than stocks.

Time Can Be Your Friend or Foe
Holding a broad portfolio of stocks over an extended period of time significantly reduces your chances of losing your principal. However, stocks are always risky investments, even over the long-term. In certain time frames, such as the 2008 to 2009 period when stock prices dropped by 57 percent, investors with the bulk of your retirement savings in stocks or stock mutual funds, might have had to reconsider your retirement plan. Unpredictable life events might make it difficult for some investors to stay invested in stocks over an extended period of time.

Managing Risk
You cannot eliminate investment risk. But two basic investment strategies—asset allocation and diversification—can help manage both systemic risk (risk affecting the economy as a whole) and non-systemic risk (risks that affect a small part of the economy, or even a single company).
Hedging and insurance products can provide additional ways to manage risk. However, both strategies typically add to the costs of your investment, which can eat away at returns. The bottom line is that all investments carry some degree of risk. By better understanding the nature of risk, and taking steps to manage those risks, you put yourself in a better position to meet your financial goals.""""""",https://www.finra.org/investors/investing/investing-basics/risk

How to convert to a Roth IRA online

If your employer offers a retirement plan, like a 401(k) or 403(b), and will match a percentage of your contributions, you should definitely take advantage of it—it's free money. Plus you'll have a tax-deferred account that makes saving a cinch through automatic payroll deduction.

If your employer doesn't offer a plan, then an IRA can be a good start to your retirement savings and another opportunity for your earnings to grow tax-free.

Facts & figures you need to know:
401(k) - Anyone who works for an employer that offers a plan can participate. The annual contribution limit varies with age and year.
IRA - Anyone with earned income can open and contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit is less than 401(k) but also varies with age and year. 

What you can invest in: 
401(k) gives you a preselected list of investment choices. On the other hand, IRA allows you to invest in a wide variety of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and individual stocks and bonds.

If you're eligible for both IRA and 401(k), you should invest in both as long as you heed contribution and income limits. An IRA offers more flexibility and choice, giving you a greater chance to diversify your assets and reduce your investment risk.

Be aware that all investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest and fluctuations in financial markets may cause declines in the value of your account. Diversification does not ensure profit or protect against a loss. Also, when taking withdrawals from an IRA before age 59½, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax.""",https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/iras/401k-vs-ira

Introduction
Saving for retirement is the gnarliest of delayed gratification challenges. For most people, Social Security benefits won't cover all the bills in retirement. To land in retirement in solid financial shape, you also want to build your own savings in 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. 

In your 20s: Cash in on compound growth
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade: You should aim to save about 1x your salary. Aim to save 10% of your gross salary pronto.

In your 30s: Stay (or get) focused
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade: You should aim to save about 3x your salary. If you're just getting started, aim to save at least 15% of your gross salary; 20% is even better.

In your 40s: Monitor your spending
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade: You should aim to save about 4x your salary. The challenge in this decade is to not take on big-ticket spending that can make it hard to keep up with your retirement plan.

In your 50s: Plan your retirement income
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade: You should aim to save about 8x your salary. Saving as much as possible remains Job One. But now's also the time to start getting a sense of how the pieces of your retirement income puzzle will fit together.

In your 60s: Focus on your age 90-plus future self
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade: You should aim to save about 10x your salary. You've rounded the bend, with retirement in your sights. The big win this decade is to assume that you will live until 95.""

13,13,"""How to get a handle on debt | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
There are many steps both big and small to getting a handle on your debt. If you’re unsure where to turn for help or who to trust, you’re not alone. We estimate that about one in three people have been contacted by a creditor or collector seeking to collect a debt within the past year. No matter your reasons for changing your financial situation, there are resources available to help you pay off what you owe. 

Consider working with a credit counselor. Credit counselors can advise you on ways to manage your money and debt and help you create and follow a budget, which can help you save or pay off a debt. Credit counselors are usually nonprofit organizations. A counselor may: offer free educational materials and workshops, review your budget and come up with a plan to address your money problems, help you decide which debts to pay first and understand what can happen if you stop making payments, make an up-front agreement with your creditors to stop collections and not charge you late fees.

Beware of debt settlement companies that charge up-front fees in return for promising to settle your debts. Debt settlement companies are different from nonprofit credit counseling organizations. These companies often claim they can make a deal with your creditors to reduce the amount of debt you owe. Beware of companies that charge up-front fees. Charging a fee before settling at least one of your debts is illegal for most debt settlement companies. Dealing with debt settlement companies can be risky; you may end up in more debt than when you started. You should avoid doing business with any debt settlement company that charges any fees before it settles your debts, tells you to stop communicating with your creditors, or guarantees it can make your debt go away.

Paying off debt can be a long journey. But using this information can get you on track to achieve your financial goals. We have additional information about working with debt collectors, including sample letters you can use for your own situation. You can also submit a complaint about a debt collection issue.

Pay Off Debt: Tools and Tips

There are several options for paying off
debt
, and that can sometimes feel overwhelming. You might be thinking about a DIY strategy combined with budgeting and side hustles to increase your income. Maybe you’re contemplating debt consolidation or feel you need to check out debt relief options.
Here’s how to choose a strategy, and some tools and tips that can help you get out of debt.
Assess your debt load
To a large extent, the best way to get out of debt will depend on how much you owe compared with your income.
Start by understanding whether you simply have
too much debt
. That gives you an idea of whether you can use a DIY strategy for payoff or should consider debt relief options.
Debt snowball:
With this strategy for getting out of debt, you focus on paying off your smallest balance first. Put all the extra money you can dedicate to debt payoff toward that account while continuing to pay the minimums on the others.
Debt avalanche:
Focus on the debt with the highest interest rate first (while paying minimums on the others), then the next highest rate and so on.
Focus on high credit utilization:
You could also focus on paying down your credit cards with the highest
credit utilization
Consider debt consolidation to get out of debt faster
Debt consolidation
takes your high-interest debt, and rolls them into one monthly payment, ideally at a lower interest rate.
Lowering your interest rate.
Making your payments more manageable.
Shortening the time it takes to pay off your debt.
Boost debt payoff with budgeting
If you feel like you don’t have enough money to cut down debt, getting clear on your
budget
may help. 
Choose a system that works for you:
Use technology to make things easier:
Lower your bills
Finding ways to reduce your monthly bills can help to free up more money to put toward debt payoff. 
Make more money
Don’t rule out the possibility of increasing your current salary. Research and preparation may help you
negotiate more money
at your current job.
Don’t be afraid of debt relief
If you’ve tried budgeting, negotiating your payments and bringing in more cash, all to no avail, you might want to try debt relief.
Debt relief
can help you change the amount or the terms of your debt to lighten your financial burden, but it’s not for everyone.

Market Structure
How different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods
What is Market Structure?
Market structure, in economics, refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for goods and services. It is based on the characteristics that influence the behavior and outcomes of companies working in a specific market.
Some of the factors that determine a market structure include the number of buyers and sellers, ability to negotiate, degree of concentration, degree of differentiation of products, and the ease or difficulty of entering and exiting the market.
Summary
Market structure refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods.
The four popular types of market structures include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.
Market structures show the relations between sellers and other sellers, sellers to buyers, or more.
Understanding Market Structures
In economics, market structures can be understood well by closely examining an array of factors or features exhibited by different players. It is common to differentiate these markets across the following seven distinct features.
The industry’s buyer structure
The turnover of customers
The extent of product differentiation
The nature of costs of inputs
The number of players in the market
Vertical integration extent in the same industry
The largest player’s market share
Based on the above features, economists have used this information to describe four distinct types of market structures. They include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.
Types of Market Structures
1.
Perfect Competition
Perfect competition occurs when there is a large number of small companies competing against each other. They sell similar products (homogeneous), lack price influence over the commodities, and are free to enter or exit the market.
Consumers in this type of market have full knowledge of the goods being sold. They are aware of the prices charged on them and the product branding. 
2.
Monopolistic Competition
Monopolistic competition refers to an imperfectly competitive market with the traits of both the monopoly and competitive market. Sellers compete among themselves and can differentiate their goods in terms of quality and branding to look different. 
3.
Oligopoly
An oligopoly market consists of a small number of large companies that sell differentiated or identical products. Since there are few players in the market, their competitive strategies are dependent on each other.
4.
Monopoly
In a monopoly market, a single company represents the whole industry. It has no competitor, and it is the sole seller of products in the entire market. This type of market is characterized by factors such as the sole claim to ownership of resources, patent and copyright, licenses issued by the government, or high initial setup costs.""",https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/market-structure/
17,17,"""Corporate Finance Fundamentals: Optimal Capital Structure
Dorothy Macasasa
Jul 26
Optimal Capital Structure
— company’s different sources of financing, such as debt, equity, and other financial instruments that allows the company to minimize its overall cost of capital and maximize shareholder value.
The optimal capital structure of a firm is often defined as the proportion of debt and equity that results to the lowest weighted average cost of debt and equity (WACC) of the firm.
As an indicator, if the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is lower than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) then it is advisable to either repurchase shares or pay cash dividends as it indicates that the company’s projects or investments are not generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. 
However, if the IRR was greater than the WACC of the business then it indicate that they may reinvest the project for better returns as it means that the project or investment is generating returns that exceed the cost of financing. 
WACC Formula
Cost of Equity
— the rate of return a shareholder requires for investing equity into business
Cost of Debt
— the rate of return a lender requires given the risk of the business
Debt Capital
— raised by borrowing money from various sources, such as banks, bondholders, or other financial institutions. It includes different forms of debt securities. 
Equity Capital
— funds raised by issuing shares of ownership in the company to investors. Equity shareholders have ownership stakes in the company and may be entitled to voting rights and a share in the company’s profits through dividends.
Knowing that the optimal capital structure relies on equity versus debt decision, it is important to take note that HAVING TOO MUCH DEBT may increase the risk of default in repayment while DEPENDING TOO HEAVYLY ON EQUITY may dilute earnings and value for investors.
Other key factors to consider when determining the optimal capital structure:
Cost of Capital
Note: Debt is usually cheaper than equity due to tax advantages (interest payments are tax-deductible), but too much debt can increase financial risk and interest expenses.
Risk Tolerance
Note: Higher debt levels can magnify financial risk, as debt obligations must be met regardless of the company’s performance.
Industry and Business Characteristics
Note: The industry in which a company operates and its business model influence the optimal capital structure. Some industries may be more debt-heavy, while others may rely more on equity financing.
Flexibility and Growth
Note: If you are expecting rapid growth or significant investment opportunities, prefer a capital structure that provides flexibility in raising additional funds.
Market Conditions
Note: Market conditions, interest rates, and investor preferences also influence the availability and cost of debt and equity financing. This includes industry trends and company’s credit score.
Debt Covenants and Restrictions
Note: Debt covenants and restrictions that come with borrowing can impact the company’s operational and financial flexibility as it may result to operational constraints, capital expenditure limitations, dividend and distribution restrictions, change of control provisions, additional collateral requirements, and costs of borrowing.

18,18,"""""""Pricing Strategy Under Each Market Structure
Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate.

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy
This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. The supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices.
Suppliers can only supply what the consumers can consume at given prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers and therefore operate for as long as production costs fall below revenue.

Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy
In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can successfully set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. 
A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products.
Also, since there are many competitors, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices.

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy
Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars.
Generally, an optimal pricing strategy, in the long run, incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors.

Monopoly Market Structure
The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits, if you may, in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.

Question
In monopolistic competitive markets, firms:
are price takers.
set their own prices.
react to the prices set by competitors.

Solution
The correct answer is B.
In monopolistic competition, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.

Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin.
Chris Hill:
I'm Chris Hill, and that was Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti. What are you buying when you buy a stock? No, really, what are you buying? Today John kicks off a two-part series on the basics of financial statements, including what goes into a balance sheet, how the sale of a burrito at
Chipotle
become shareholder equity, and how financial statements work together.
John Rotonti:
Fools, John Rotonti here. Today we are going to be talking about the three primary financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. Let's just start with the balance sheet really quickly. The balance sheet, Fools, is called the balance sheet because it must balance at all times, and the simple formula is assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity, and that must always balance. A must always equal L plus SE, assets equals liabilities plus shareholders equity. Let's just look at a quick example using Chipotle, ticker CMG. Chipotle has total assets, so assets of 6,653 million. Then it has total liabilities of 4,355.6 million and total shareholders' equity of 2,297.4 million. If you remember, A, assets, equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity. So if we take the liabilities of Chipotle of 4,355.6, and we add the shareholders' equity of 2,297.4, you will get the total assets of 6,653 to the penny. 
Now shareholders' equity has two other names. They all mean the same thing. They're synonyms. Shareholders' equity is also book value. How do you calculate book value? Total assets minus total liabilities. Book value is literally the value of your assets, what you own minus your total liabilities, what you owe. The other synonym for total equity is net worth. This is the company's net worth. Just like you can calculate your personal net worth based on your total assets, what you own, minus your total liabilities, what you owe. So total shareholders equity is equal to book value is equal to net worth. One last thing before I move on to the next financial statement. Think of assets, as we've said, that's what you own, that's the left-hand side of that equation. The other side of the equation, liabilities and shareholders' equity is the sources of funds to buy those assets.
We're going to switch over to the income statement really quickly, sticking with Chipotle here. Some people call this the profit and loss statement, the P&L. We went over this in a prior segment, but it's important to review again because we're going to need it for when we get to the cash flow statement. So bear with me really quickly. The sale or revenue, think of those words as synonyms. I think a lot of companies that actually sell a tangible product use the word sales, and companies like software that don't sell tangible product that you can touch and feel use the word revenue. But honestly, I've seen product companies use the word revenue, and I've seen software and services company use word sales. It doesn't matter. Honestly, sales and revenue are the exact same thing, and they are the top line of the income statement. They are the top line because they are at the top of the piece of paper. 
From that, we subtract the cost of goods sold. That is all of the input costs as well as the employee wages that go into making that burrito. This does not include the salary of the CEO, and the COO, and everything else back at headquarters. This includes the people working in the Chipotle kitchen. Those are wages that are included in cost of goods sold. It also includes the chicken, or whether it's beef, or pork, whatever you're putting in your burrito. Avocados, those things are expensive. Those things are going through the moon. Avocados, tomatoes, onions, other basil, and spices. You got to have the chicken, or whether it's beef, or pork, whatever you're putting in your burrito. You take revenue, the $7 burrito, you subtract your cost of goods sold, and you get a number called gross profit. This is what we talk about when we're talking about unit economics.
When you're talking about gross profit, you are talking about unit economics, you're also talking about pricing power. What if sales grow a little faster than cost of goods sold grow? You know the answer. That means your gross profit margin is going to increase over time, a sign of pricing power.
So we have gross profit. From that, we subtract operating expenses. You got to keep the lights on. You got to pay your utilities. You got to pay all of the other salaries and expenses back at headquarters, if there's research and development. All of these things are operating expenses. These are cost of doing business. That's operating expenses. So gross profit, you subtract these operating expenses, you got to keep your lights on, you get operating income.
From operating income or EBIT, we subtract the interest expense on the debt, if the company has any debt. Notice debt holders get paid first. They have a primary claim on a company's cash flows. There is a packing order, Fools, to who gets paid. Debt holders, or creditors, they get paid first. We just paid the I, the interest expense. Remember, we had E-B-I-T. We just pay the interest, so now we are left with E-B-T, earnings before taxes. So who gets paid next? The government in the form of taxes. So debt holders get paid first, and then the government in the form of taxes. Now what is left over after the company has paid its cost of goods sold, after the company has paid all of those other operating expenses, utility bills, research and development, sales and marketing, after the company has paid its interest on its debt, if it has any, after the company has paid its taxes to the government, if there is money left over, that is called net income, or net profit, or net earnings.
The three words mean the same thing, and that, Fools, is what you are buying as a shareholder. We get the residual claim of what is left over after all of those expenses we just went through are paid. We get residual claim. We get the bottom line. Why is it called the bottom line? Because it is at the bottom of the income statement. We get what is leftover. We have a residual claim on a company's cash flows. When you buy a stock, legally, what are you buying? When you buy a stock, you are buying a claim on the company's future net income, or future net profits, or future net earnings. You are buying a very small percentage of the company's future net income. That, Fools, is the income statement. Now why do I want to go through that? Because when you buy a stock, that's what you're legally buying, but also because we need to go to the cash flow statement, the third financial statement. Now remember how I just said net income is the bottom line of the cash flow statement? Guess what, net income, the same exact number that's on that income statement, then becomes the top line of the cash flow statement.
Chris Hill:
That was part 1. Next Saturday, on part 2, John will dig into the cash flow statement and all the places your money can go before it gets to shareholders. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you tomorrow.

Financial Analysis
What is Net Present Value?
Net present value is an analysis tool used to decide whether to invest in a capital asset. It is employed as part of the capital budgeting process. A desirable investment is one that yields a positive net present value, which implies that a business will receive excess cash over time as a result of the investment. A negative net present value indicates that a company will lose money on a proposed investment. A negative net present value is usually grounds to terminate an investment that is under consideration.
How to Calculate Net Present Value
Net present value is calculated as the difference between the present value of one or more inbound cash flows and one or more outbound cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology is used to derive present value, using a discount rate as the basis for the discounting. The discount rate is typically based on the cost of capital of the business running the analysis. If the cash flows associated with a proposed investment are expected to be unusually risky, then the discount rate may be increased, thereby reducing the net present value of the associated cash flows.
Advantages of Net Present Value
A key benefit of net present value is that it reduces the cash flows associated with a project to one numeric value, which can be easily compared to the net present values of other projects. The project generating the highest net present value is then selected for investment, while the other projects are assigned a lower priority or rejected.
Disadvantages of Net Present Value
Net present value is not a perfect analysis tool, for it suffers from several problems. First, estimated cash flows rarely match actual results, especially when the original estimates are excessively optimistic. Second, the discount rate used for a capital asset analysis may not be appropriate, given the incremental cost of the capital required to fund a project. Third, an adjustment of the discount rate to account for risk is usually a guess; there is no quantitative derivation of the adjustment. And finally, an investment based on a net present value analysis only looks at the circumstances of a specific investment, rather than the entire system of profit generation; thus, investments using NPV can be sub-optimized.

26,26,"""5 Methods for Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting is defined as the process used to determine whether capital assets are worth investing in. Capital assets are generally only a small portion of a company’s total assets, but they are usually long-term investments like new equipment, facilities, and software upgrades. Finance professionals need to develop an understanding of the five primary methods of capital budgeting, which include: 

Internal Rate of Return
The internal rate of return calculation is used to determine whether a particular investment is worthwhile. It helps aid investors in measuring the potential profitability of their investments.

Net Present Value
Net present value (NPV) is used for analyzing the projected returns for a potential investment or project. NPV accounts for the time value of money, so opportunity costs and inflation are not ignored. 

Profitability Index
The profitability index is designed to identify the relationship between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was successful. 

Accounting Rate of Return
The accounting rate of return is the projected return that an organization can expect from a proposed capital investment. It is a useful metric for quickly calculating the profitability of a company.

Payback Period
The payback period is a financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been invested. Understanding the payback period of an investment limits the risks associated with taking on costly projects.

It’s important that firms remain mindful of their cash flows and capital assets to ensure that their investments prove profitable in the long term. This way, companies can reap full benefits of capital budgeting.""",https://online.norwich.edu/online/about/resource-library/5-methods-capital-budgeting
27,27,"""What is Financial Modeling?
Financial modeling is one of the most highly valued, but thinly understood, skills in financial analysis. The objective of financial modeling is to combine accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.
A financial model is simply a spreadsheet that forecasts a business’s financial performance into the future. The forecast is typically based on the company’s historical performance and assumptions about the future, and requires preparing an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and supporting schedules.

Key Highlights
Financial modeling combines accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.
The main goal of financial modeling is to accurately project a company’s future financial performance.
Modeling can be useful for valuing companies, determining whether a company should raise capital or grow the business organically or through acquisitions.

What is a Financial Model Used For?
There are many types of financial models with a wide range of uses. Financial models are used to make decisions about:
Raising capital 
Making acquisitions 
Growing the business organically 
Selling or divesting assets and business units
Budgeting and forecasting
Capital allocation 
Valuing a business

What Software is Best for Financial Modeling?
Each business is unique and requires a specific set of assumptions and calculations. Excel is used because it is the most flexible and customizable spreadsheet tool available. 

Who Builds Financial Models?
There are many different types of professionals who build financial models. The most common types of career tracks are investment banking, equity research, corporate development, FP&A, and accounting.

How Can You Learn Financial Modeling?
The best way to learn financial modeling is to practice. It takes years of experience to become an expert at building financial models, and you really have to learn by doing. 

How Much Accounting Knowledge is Required for Financial Modeling?
In order to build a financial model, you need a solid understanding of accounting fundamentals.

Financial modeling is the application of data analysis to predict business performance, manage assets, and track cash flow. Financial modeling is a vital tool, essential for a business to succeed, whether it is a startup or a Fortune 500 company. A financial modeling course on Udemy can familiarize you with the concepts and strategies vital to business success.

What is financial modeling?
Research analysts, investment bankers, accountants, and entrepreneurs use financial modeling to better understand a company’s performance before making important business decisions. Financial models are generated using MS Excel and can help you accomplish a variety of important tasks such as forecasting business performance, budgeting, asset management, and understanding cash flow. Financial modeling requires a keen sense of numbers and data to prepare the best financial reports for yourself or your clients.

What are some examples of financial models and what are they used for?
There are several different types of financial models used by professionals to help them make the best business decisions. Financial models help professionals make important business decisions about raising capital, forecasting business changes and requirements, or what it will take to grow a business. Some examples of these useful financial models are the discounted cash flow (DCF), a valuation method used to determine the worth of investing in a business; leveraged buyout (LBO), which examines the impact of funding an acquisition with debt; and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a method that analyzes the result of acquiring or merging with another company.

What does an investment banker do?
Investment bankers assist corporations and individual investors by making a variety of critical decisions to best ensure the success of their business and financial growth. Investment bankers work in capital markets, advisory, trading and brokerage, and asset management. Investment bankers usually work for investment banks that serve business clients. They provide guidance and expertise to corporate clients seeking to issue an IPO (initial public offering) to raise capital that they could use to expand a business, acquire, or merge with another company.

What are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows?
Balance sheets help business owners, investment bankers, and accountants understand the assets of a business. In particular, balance sheets outline what the business owns, or its assets. It also notes what the business owes, or its debt and liabilities. A company’s income statement is just as important as its balance sheet and tells you how much profit a company generated during a particular year. The statement of cash flows is a useful tool for stakeholders and can provide insight into how effectively the organization manages its operations. Businesses use a statement of cash flows to understand a company’s performance, more specifically, to assess a company’s ability to generate cash from operations, financing, and investing.""",https://www.udemy.com/topic/financial-modeling/
30,30,"""What Is Risk Management in Finance, and Why Is It Important?

Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. It is the process of monitoring and dealing with the financial risks associated with investing. Risk is inseparable from return in the investment world.

Key Takeaways:
Risk management is the process of identification, analysis, and acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decisions.
Risk is inseparable from return in the investment world.
Risk management strategies include avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction.
One of the tactics to ascertain risk is standard deviation, a statistical measure of dispersion around a central tendency.

How Risk Management Works:
Risk is inseparable from return. A solid understanding of risk in its different forms can help investors to better understand the opportunities, trade-offs, and costs involved with different investment approaches.
Risk management involves identifying and analyzing where risk exists, and making decisions about how to deal with it. It occurs everywhere in the realm of finance.

Types of Risk Management:
Beta and Passive: One risk measure oriented to behavioral tendencies is a drawdown, which refers to any period during which an asset's return is negative relative to a previous high mark.
Alpha and Active: Returns vary because of a number of factors unrelated to market risk.
Investment managers who follow an active strategy take on other risks to achieve excess returns over the market's performance.

The Cost of Risk:
The pricing difference between passive (beta risk) and active strategies (alpha risk) encourages many investors to try and separate these risks.

Example of Risk Management:
During a 15-year period from Aug. 1, 1992, to July 31, 2007, the average annualized total return of the S&P 500 was 10.7%. This number reveals what happened for the whole period, but it does not say what happened along the way.

Why Is Risk Management Important?
Risk management is a key part of the investment and financial world. Risk management allows individuals to reach their goals while mitigating or dealing with any of the associated losses.

How Can I Practice Risk Management in Personal Finance?
Start by identifying your goals, and then highlight the risks associated with your objectives. Once you know what the risks are, evaluate them and research the best ways to manage these risks.

How Do Companies Manage Their Operational Risk?
Companies can manage it by identifying and assessing potential risks, measuring them, and putting controls in place to either mitigate or eliminate them altogether.

The Bottom Line:
Risk is an integral part of the financial world. Knowing what the risks are, how to identify them, and employing suitable risk management techniques can help mitigate losses while you reap the rewards.""

65,65,"""""""Behavioral Finance
Behavioral finance is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It also includes the subsequent effects on the markets. It focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases.

Traditional Financial Theory
Traditional finance includes the following beliefs:
Both the market and investors are perfectly rational
Investors truly care about utilitarian characteristics
Investors have perfect self-control
They are not confused by cognitive errors or information processing errors

Behavioral Finance Theory
Traits of behavioral finance are:
Investors are treated as “normal” not “rational”
They actually have limits to their self-control
Investors are influenced by their own biases
Investors make cognitive errors that can lead to wrong decisions

Decision-Making Errors and Biases
Behavioral finance views investors as “normal” but being subject to decision-making biases and errors. 

#1 Self-Deception
The concept of self-deception is a limit to the way we learn. 

#2 Heuristic Simplification
Heuristic simplification refers to information-processing errors.

#3 Emotion
Emotion in behavioral finance refers to our making decisions based on our current emotional state. 

#4 Social Influence
Social bucket is how our decision-making is influenced by others.

Top 10 Biases in Behavioral Finance
Common biases include:
Overconfidence and illusion of control
Self Attribution Bias
Hindsight Bias
Confirmation Bias
The Narrative Fallacy
Representative Bias
Framing Bias
Anchoring Bias
Loss Aversion
Herding Mentality

Overcoming Behavioral Finance Issues
#1 Focus on the Process
Reflexive – Going with your gut, which is effortless, automatic and, in fact, is our default option
Reflective – Logical and methodical, but requires effort to engage in actively
#2 Prepare, Plan and Pre-Commit
Behavioral finance teaches us to invest by preparing, by planning, and by making sure we pre-commit.",https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/behavioral-finance/: https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/behavioral-finance/

68,68,"""Prospect Theory - Overview, Phases, and Features
Prospect Theory
A psychology theory that states that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains.
What is Prospect Theory?
Prospect theory is a psychology theory that describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and
uncertainty. It holds that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains.
Given the choice of equal probabilities, most people would choose to retain the wealth that they already have, rather than risk the chance to increase their current wealth. People are usually averse to the possibility of losing, such that they would rather avoid a loss rather than take a risk to make an equivalent gain.
History of Prospect Theory
The prospect theory is sometimes referred to as the loss-aversion theory. The theory was introduced by two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman, and Amos Tversky, to describe how humans make decisions when presented with several choices.
The theory was contained in the paper “
Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk
” that was published in the “Econometrica” journal in 1979. Since it was developed, the prospect theory’s been used in various disciplines. It is used to evaluate various aspects of political decision-making in international relations.
Phases of Prospect Theory
The theory describes the decision-making process in two phases, which include:
1. Editing phase
The editing phase refers to how people involved in decision-making characterize the options for choice or the framing effects. The effects explain how a person’s choice is influenced by the wording, order, or method in which the choices are presented.
An example to demonstrate the framing effect can be the choices that cancer patients are given. Usually, cancer patients are presented with the choice of undergoing surgery or chemotherapy to treat their illnesses, and they make a decision based on whether the outcome statistics are presented in terms of survival rates or mortality rates. Once the choices have been framed ready for decision-making, the theory enters the second phase.
2. Evaluation phase
In the evaluation phase, people tend to behave as if they would make a decision based on the potential outcomes and choose the option with a higher utility. The phase uses statistical analysis to measure and compare the outcomes of each prospect. The evaluation phase comprises two indices, i.e., the value function and the weighting function, which are used to compare the prospects.
Features of the Prospect Theory
The prospects theory comes with the following characteristics:
1. Certainty
When presented with several options to choose from, humans show a strong preference for the option with certainty. They are willing to sacrifice the option that offers more potential income in order to achieve more certainty. 
2. Small probabilities
People tend to discount very small probabilities even if there is a possibility of losing all their wealth. By discounting the small probabilities, people end up choosing higher-risk options with higher probabilities.
3. Relative positioning
Relative positioning means that people tend to focus less on their final income or wealth, and more on the relative gains or losses that they will get.  
4. Loss aversion
People tend to give more weight to losses rather than gains made by taking a certain option.
Criticism of Prospect Theory
One of the criticisms of the prospects theory is that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about. The criticism comes from other psychologists who notes that factors such as human emotional and affective responses that are important in the decision-making process are absent in the model.
The theory is also criticized for the inadequate framing theory that explains why actors generate the frames they use. Decision-makers often need to deal with competing frames across various issues.""",https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/prospect-theory/: https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/prospect-theory/

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress in response to financial industry behavior that led to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. It sought to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers. Named for sponsors Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the act contains numerous provisions, spelled out over 848 pages, that were to be implemented over a period of several years. 

The Dodd-Frank Act targeted financial system sectors that were believed to have caused the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Leading up to 2007, lax regulations led to extremely risky lending practices, which caused a housing sector bubble that ultimately burst and drove the global crisis, the need for public bailouts of financial institutions, and the recession. The institutions considered responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis included banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies. 

Critics of the law argue that the regulatory burdens it imposes could make U.S. firms less competitive than their foreign counterparts. In 2018, Congress passed a new law that rolled back some of Dodd-Frank’s restrictions. Understanding the Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a massive piece of financial reform legislation that was passed in 2010, during the Obama administration.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2007–2008. 

When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, he pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank. Siding with critics, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which rolled back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It was signed into law by then-President Trump on May 24, 2018.

Proponents of Dodd-Frank believed that the law would prevent the economy from experiencing a crisis like that of 2007–2008 and protect consumers from many of the abuses that contributed to the crisis. Detractors, however, have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, they contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions, despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis.

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, was a direct response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing government bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This law established a wide range of reforms throughout the entire financial system, with the purpose of preventing a repeat of the 2007–2008 crisis and the need for further government bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act also included additional protections for consumers.

Although the Trump administration reversed and weakened several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly those affecting consumers, the Biden administration intends to reestablish and strengthen the previous reversals to protect individuals who may be subject to predatory lending practices in industries like for-profit education and automobiles.""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp
