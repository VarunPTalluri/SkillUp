Everyday shoppers around the world are choosing to pay for their items with mobile devices in their hands instead of the cash and credit cards in their wallets. This is all thanks to improved technology, better connectivity, and superior all-around convenience. Local payments made via mobile devices are experiencing dramatic growth worldwide with no signs of slowing. Mobile and Digital Payments Revolution Is Happening Now. Is Your Business Ready?

Three Types of Mobile Payments Commonly Used by Global Consumers:
Mobile Point of Sale: Growing in popularity around the world, mobile point of sale replaces a fixed POS terminal with a phone or tablet and uses special hardware to allow for payment via credit or debit card.
Remote Mobile Payments: Whether it's on an app like Amazon or a website like Nike.com, you are conducting a remote mobile payment whenever you purchase something via your mobile device.
Mobile Proximity Payments: Similar to mobile point-of-sale, mobile proximity payments are any transactions that occur at a point of sale where shoppers use a mobile device to pay in place of credit cards or cash. These transactions are useful for stores to accept mobile payments. 

Digital Wallets Are Replacing Traditional Ones: As more shoppers rely on their phones to make purchases, they are reaching into their wallets less often. With that trend comes the rise of digital wallets, a preferred local payment method for both remote mobile payments and mobile proximity payments. 

There are two types of digital wallets growing in popularity across the world, closed-loop wallets and open-loop wallets. Closed-Loop Wallet is offered by retailers to increase loyalty, offer discounts, and learn more about their shoppers. Open-Loop Wallet: This type of digital wallet works more like a traditional wallet by storing bank and credit information and allowing shoppers to use it wherever its an accepted form of payment.

Experts predict the digital payments market to increase in value to almost 13 trillion by 2027, and mobile payments are set to be a key part of this revolution. In response, merchants must adopt mobile payments or risk being left behind.
