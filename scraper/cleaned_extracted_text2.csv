0,0,"""""""Solvency II is the prudential regime for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the EU. It has entered into force in January 2016. Solvency II sets out requirements applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies in the EU with the aim to ensure the adequate protection of policyholders and beneficiaries. Solvency II has a risk-based approach that enables to assess the overall solvency of insurance and reinsurance undertakings through quantitative and qualitative measures. The Solvency II regulatory framework is built on a three-pillar structure. Pillar I sets the quantitative requirements i.e. the assets and liabilities valuation and capital requirements. Pillar II sets the qualitative requirements including governance and risk management of the undertakings and the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment. 

Pillar III sets the supervisory reporting and public disclosure. The three pillars form a coherent approach that allows to understand and to manage risks across the sector. The key features of the Solvency II regulatory framework are Market consistent assets and liabilities shall be valued at the amount for which they can be exchanged, transferred or settled in the market. Risk-based Higher risks will lead to a higher capital requirement to cover for unexpected losses. Proportional regulatory requirements shall be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to the business of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings. Group supervision, supervisors shall increase coordination and exchange of information in colleges of supervisors to improve cross-border supervision of insurance and reinsurance groups. The Solvency II legislation is implemented on three levels.

Solvency II Directive The Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance Solvency II lays down the general principles. Level 2 the Delegated Regulation and Implementing technical standards The Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance Solvency II is a directly applicable legislative act which does not require any additional implementation. Implementing technical standards are legislative provisions made by the European Commission on the basis of advice received from EIOPA.

The implementing technical standards are accessible via the rulebook. Level 3 Guidelines EIOPA issues guidelines and recommendations to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices and to ensure common and consistent application of Union law. National supervisory authorities are required to incorporate them following a comply or explain process. In 1999, the European Commission presented its paper on The Review of the Overall Financial Position of an Insurance Undertaking. The discussion took particular importance in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis showed the importance of a harmonised understanding of the risks by all involved actors and the need for considering wider implications for financial stability. It crystallised the need for bringing the regulatory framework at the forefront of modern risk management, reflecting the reality of large groups operating on a cross-border basis.""""""

Blockchain not bitcoin emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market's performance woes, the new version does the same but swaps in crypto to reflect the ecosystem's spread. By Noelle Acheson Dec 13 2022 at 6:54 p.m. UTC Updated Sep 28 2023 at 2:24 p.m. UTC. Last week Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled 'Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto' in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Last month Citi published the results of a survey showing that 92% of participating institutions see value in tokenization while 88% are either exploring distributed ledger use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. Over the past few days the Red Cross talked about ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group announced plans to work on soulbound tokens for digital identity. Bitcoin was an asset with no backing or clear utility, the implied argument seemed to go, whereas blockchain, well, that was a technology. Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her 'Crypto Is Macro Now' newsletter which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes.

10,10,"""""""Cryptocurrency Explained With Pros and Cons for Investment. By Jake Frankenfield. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority. Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. Cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. Cryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses due to scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. Cryptocurrencies represent a new decentralized paradigm for money. Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities. Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap. The Bottom Line Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative and it is important to understand the risks involved before investing.""""""",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp
11,11,"""Blockchain101 - The Ultimate Guide for Beginners. Blockchain is a decentralized record-keeping technology that stores data unalterably on a public ledger. The fact that it is decentralized, censorship-proof, immutable and tamper-proof makes blockchain a completely secure technology. In a blockchain network, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), every node works to prevent errors and verify transactions. Blockchain uses blocks that are chained together to store data. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. The fist and most famous thing to represent the use of blockchain is Bitcoin.

Blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that enables users to transact without any centralized authority. The consensus about the state of balances and transactions among network validators is reached via a consensus mechanism with Proof-of-Work used by Bitcoin and Proof-of-Stake used by Ethereum being the most popular ones. Blockchain technology is not just related to cryptocurrencies: judiciary, banks, logistics companies, the entertainment industry and many other sectors are putting ever more emphasis on blockchain solutions. Smart contract capabilities, tokenization, and immutability are major benefits that blockchain technology offers to companies. Essentially, blockchain technology is capable of facilitating a low-cost and secure way of keeping digital data records.

Blockchain technology, one of the best use cases of distributed ledger technology, is essentially a decentralized data-storing digital ledger. The most commonly used algorithms are Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). PoW networks like Bitcoin rely on powerful computer hardware for transaction validation and new block production. 

Cryptocurrencies are the most common digital assets using blockchain technology. Bitcoin was put forward as a project by a pseudonymous individual creator or group named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Bitcoin network and the first block were launched in 2009. Litecoin, created by Charlie Lee in 2011, is the second cryptocurrency created using open-source codes directly following in Bitcoin's footsteps.

There are many governments and companies embracing the use of blockchain and IoT technologies for digital assets, personal health information, property deeds, prescription records, supply chain records and more.

Different blockchain networks adopt different consensus mechanisms and use those algorithms. A decentralized consensus must be relied on for an error-free coded algorithm. The two most commonly preferred consensus mechanisms are Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, followed by Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) algorithms.

Every technology has its advantages and disadvantages, blockchain is no exception. Blockchain technology provides users with an increasing number of benefits everyday. A significant part of these benefits is based on decentralization, immutability, and security. Records in blocks validated on the blockchain cannot be changed or deleted. This means that the data cannot be tampered with. Hacking blockchains is quite difficult as it is a technology protected by hundreds of thousands or even millions of computers worldwide.

Blockchain projects are built around three key features: scalability, decentralization, and security. Most projects have had to sacrifice one feature to make the other two stand out.

Since entering the mainstream in the 2010s, the research and development efforts in the blockchain space have resulted in some truly groundbreaking innovations, which will, in all likelihood, play a major role in finance, entertainment, and several other aspects of human life going forward.

Smart Contracts are arguably the biggest and most striking capability that blockchain technology has brought. 

Non-Fungible Tokens are unique assets that reflect all assets in the digital or real world.

Decentralized finance represents finance protocols built on blockchains.

Blockchain technology is rapidly increasing use cases around the world. More users, companies, and governments are discovering how blockchain technology can help them and are supporting its further development.""",https://coincodex.com/article/19566/blockchain-101-the-ultimate-guide-for-beginners/

19,19,"""""""How AI, Cloud Tech, Web3 and the Metaverse Are Changing Banking. Banks are revamping their digital strategies to make better use of technology at their companies. AI and cloud tech are giving some banks an edge over competitors and enticing brand loyalty. Outdated IT systems are hard to modernize but they must be updated to meet current needs. Digital transformation is a must for banks. With online banking now the norm, digital transformation is no longer optional for banks. It's a necessity to remain competitive and meet customers' evolving needs. Legacy banking systems were not designed to provide the banking experience that people expect today. Simply changing the customer channels without attacking the core and customer-servicing systems cannot deliver the customer experience or low cost to serve what digitally native banks can. 

For example, many banks have replaced physical branches and call center teams with live chats and FAQ website sections to reduce the overhead of their customer-support functions. AI is automating banking transactions and processes. Banks are increasingly automating the banking experience by adopting AI tools and developing AI-generated products. In the long run, it could help banks accelerate product development further improving their competitive edge and satisfying evolving customer expectations. 

Cloud is powering the world's biggest banks. From Morgan Stanley's cloud transformation partnership with Microsoft to Bank of America saving 2 billion a year with its private cloud, banks are adopting cloud-computing infrastructure as they look to launch products and services that are fit for purpose in 2023. Cloud technology is also accelerating innovation across the banking industry. 

Then there is the next iteration of the internet known as Web3 will likely bring new possibilities to the banking industry. In particular, Web3 technologies such as cryptocurrencies, blockchains, smart contracts, and nonfungible tokens are introducing a new security standard for financial interactions as customers expect more reassurance in their financial dealings. 

A major impact is expected from the metaverse, an immersive online world. By creating virtual spaces for banking, this innovative approach promises to provide customers with personalized and immersive interactions like never before. 

From AI to the metaverse, many technologies are available for banks looking to stay competitive and retain brand loyalty. But of course, many of these technologies will be new to banks and they might experience teething problems with adoption. 

For banks with legacy IT systems, pairing them with newer infrastructure might be challenging because they likely weren't designed to handle today's technical and security requirements. But comprehensive integration should be the first consideration when embarking on a digital-transformation project or else companies risk lost data and rendering some systems obsolete, unable to communicate with any new software.""""""",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ai-cloud-technology-web3-metaverse-disrupting-banking-industry-2023-9
20,20,"""""""Nine Key Reasons Online Banking Benefits Small Business. With online banking services, companies can save both time and resources while also keeping track of their expenses in a convenient and cost-efficient way. Gone are the days when a company representative had to go to the bank in-person to deposit a check or withdraw cash for wages as all of these operations can now be done almost exclusively online. Small business owners especially stand to gain a lot from using their banks online services to generate value and save time--time that can be dedicated to growing the organization instead. 

To help business owners better navigate the world of online financial operations, we asked nine members of Forbes Finance Council for their opinions on some of the key benefits of online banking that entrepreneurs tend to overlook. Member explain why online banking is great for small businesses. 

1. Seamless Syncing With Accounting: Accounting is one of the biggest pains for business owners. Online banking and online accounting systems have made it easier than ever to make sure you have all of your transactions synced with your accounting system without needing to spend hours manually adding transactions. This saves business owners time and money and makes it easier to have up-to-date financial reports. 

2. Improved Security: At some point you may need others to manage your books. Online banking allows small businesses to customize employee access. Since not all employees need access to all accounts, online banking enables features to share certain content with select employee logins. The online account can be set up on a need-to-know basis and thus improves your overall company financial security.

3. Better Organization: A great overlooked benefit to online banking is how it helps you organize your finances. The convenience of having your account at your fingertips pairs with the opportunity to view all your transactions in one easy place. You can monitor where your money goes, stay on top of bills, and even set up recurring payments.

4. Worldwide Access: The days of having to call your bank or wait for a paper statement in order to check your balance or see what has cleared already are gone. You can now just login from almost anywhere in the world to check account balances, verify payment or confirm a check has cleared.

5. No Branches, No Paperwork: Done right, online small business banking has the potential to vastly improve business back-office productivity. No more waiting in line at branches. No faxing forms. No customer service hold.

6. Fraud Alerts: Online banking allows you to see your transactions in real-time and if something seems off, your bank will alert you. 

7. Easy Tracking: Online banking offers you an easy-to-follow audit trail. When you opt to use bill pay in online banking, tracking your incomes and outflows is effortless.

8. Mobile Check Deposit: One of my favorite features is the mobile check deposit. Now you can take a picture of your check and deposit it through your banks mobile app.

9. Easier Vendor Payments: One overlooked feature is business bill pay. Why waste time writing and mailing a check when you are always on the go. As a simple setup in your banks bill pay and a check is mailed directly to your vendor and as an added bonus the check is certified funds. Alternatively, you can ACH the payment if its an ongoing relationship--even businesses like direct deposit.""""""",https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/08/14/nine-key-reasons-online-banking-benefits-small-business/

22,22,"""Mobile Payments vs. Credit Card Payments. Mobile payments have never been more popular. People are using mobile payments these days to complete quick transactions through their mobile devices. You'll notice a few distinct differences when looking at mobile and credit card payments. Many of these entail the technologies used and how people may find mobile payments to be more useful for their needs.

The Concept of a Mobile Payment
A mobile payment entails a transaction made through a mobile device. The customer can use a smartphone, smartwatch or even a wristband. The user will pay for something with a mobile payment solution like Apple Pay or Google Pay. The system incorporates credit card or bank data in one platform. The user will transmit ones payment information from that account to the retailer to complete the purchase.

Each mobile payment comes from a digital wallet. The wallet will link to an appropriate interface or platform. The wallet will include the bank or card info. The mobile payment system takes the payment info from the digital wallet and uses it to cover the transaction. 

A Safer Solution
One difference between mobile payments and credit card deals is that mobile transactions are safer. A mobile payment can help the customer send data from a digital wallet to the retailer completing the transaction without providing any cards. The mobile payment system ensures full security over a deal. You won't see that same security with a credit card. Although credit cards have evolved to feature a chip-based system that is harder to hack, there is always the potential for someone to steal a card. 

A person can always steal a card or its identifying numbers and use it to commit fraud. But with a mobile transaction, the thief would have to use a thumbprint scan or other system to confirm ones identity. It would be tough for that person to try and duplicate that thumbprint in this process. Many mobile devices are also locked through PINs or other biometric features so that adds extra security to the deal.

How People Get These Systems
People will apply for credit cards by filling out the proper forms for getting them ready. People will submit credit info to highlight their ability to pay their balances. Some people may be rejected for cards if they have poor credit ratings. The ones that do get accepted may be subject to high interest rates and restrictive charges.

A mobile payment is different as a customer will require a suitable payment app on ones device. Google Pay and Apple Pay are the most prominent apps although Samsung Pay is available on many Samsung devices. The user will link ones existing bank or card info to the app. The system is simple and gives the customer more power over how one will pay for items. Since people don't need credit to get a mobile payment account, you can expect these payments to be more common. 

Convenience For the Customer
Customers also use mobile transactions because they are more convenient Theres no need for the customer to keep lots of cards on hand. The customers payment info is all on the same mobile payment app. It takes less time to complete a mobile payment than it does to run a credit card. It is easier to track a phone or other smart device if it gets lost than if ones credit card was lost.

Will Mobile Payments Take Over?
It is possible that mobile payments will become more popular than credit cards after a while. It will take a long time before anyone can figure out what will happen. The problem with mobile payments is that many people are uncertain about how they work. They also might not have the mobile devices necessary to complete these payments. 

You can expect mobile payments to become more prominent especially as mobile devices become more accessible. Potential advances in payment technology will also help increase the chances for these payments to be popular and useful among people. Whatever happens, it will be exciting for people to see as they look at how payment trends change and people start to see whats more efficient and effective.""
