What Is an Economic Indicator?

An economic indicator is a piece of economic data, usually of

macroeconomic

scale, that is used by analysts to interpret current or future investment possibilities. These indicators also help to judge the overall health of an economy. Economic indicators can be anything the investor chooses, but specific pieces of data released by the government and non-profit organizations have become widely followed. Such indicators include but aren't limited to the

Consumer Price Index (CPI)

,

gross domestic product

(GDP), or unemployment figures.

Key Takeaways

An economic indicator is a macroeconomic measurement used by analysts to understand current and future economic activity and opportunity.

The most widely-used economic indicators come from data released by the government and non-profit organizations or universities.

Indicators can be leading—which tend to precede trends, lagging—which confirm trends, or coincident—that which is happening now.

Indicators can also be lagging, which means they report economic circumstances but only after the circumstance has materialized.

Indicators can give investors insight as to how trades may play out, though unreliability of data and inconsistence of variables may yield indicators less helpful.

Types of Economic Indicators

Economic indicators can be divided into categories or groups. Most of these economic indicators have a specific schedule for release, allowing

investors

to prepare for and plan on seeing certain information at certain times of the month and year.

Leading Indicators

Leading indicators

, such as the yield curve, consumer durables, net business formations, and share prices, are used to predict the future movements of an economy. The numbers or data on these financial guideposts will move or change before the economy, thus their category's name. Consideration of the information from these indicators must be taken with a grain of salt, as they can be incorrect.

Investors are most often interested in leading indicators, as a correctly placed leading indicator means certain measures correctly predicted the future. Leading indicators are prepared making broad economic assumptions. For example, many investors track forward-looking yield curves to project how future interest rates may dictate stock or bond performance. This analysis relies on historical data; based on how investments performed the last time the yield curve was a certain way, some may assume those same investments will repeat their performance.

Coincident Indicators

Coincident indicators

, which include such things as GDP, employment levels, and retail sales, are seen with the occurrence of specific economic activities. This class of metrics shows the activity of a particular area or region. Many policymakers and economists follow this real-time data, as it provides the most insight into to what is actually happening. These types of indicators also allow for policymakers to leverage real data without delay to make informed decisions.

Coincident indicators are somewhat less helpful to investors, as the economic situation has already blossomed. As opposed to a forecast or a prediction, a coincident indicator informs investors of what is actually happening in the present. Therefore coincident indicators are only useful to those who can correctly interpret how economic conditions today (i.e. falling GDP) will impact future periods.

Lagging Indicators

Lagging indicators

, such as gross national product (GNP), CPI, unemployment rates, and interest rates, are only seen after a specific economic activity occurs. As the name implies, these data sets show information after the event has happened. This trailing indicator is a technical indicator that comes after large economic shifts.

The problem with lagging indicators is the strategy or response to these indicators may be too late. For example, by the time the Federal Reserve interprets CPI data and decides how best to enact monetary policy to stem inflation, the numbers they are observing are slightly outdated. Though lagging indicators are still used by many governments and institutions, they also pose the risk of guiding incorrect decision-making due to incorrect assumptions about present-day economics.

Indicators provide signs along the road, but the best investors utilize many economic indicators, combining them to glean insight into patterns and verifications within multiple sets of data.

Interpreting Economic Indicators

An economic indicator is only useful if one interprets it correctly. History has shown strong

correlations

between

economic growth

, as measured by GDP, and corporate profit growth. However, determining whether a specific company may grow its earnings based on one indicator of GDP is nearly impossible.

There is no denying the objective importance of interest rates, gross domestic product, and existing home sales or other indexes. Why objectively important? Because what you're really measuring is the cost of money, spending, investment, and the activity level of a major portion of the overall economy.

Like many other forms of financial or economic metrics, economic indicators hold tremendous value when compared across a period of time. For example, governments may observe how unemployment rates have fluctuated over the past five years. A single instance of unemployment rates doesn't yield much value; however, comparing it to prior periods allows analysts to better gauge a statistic.

In addition, many economic indicators have a benchmark set, whether by a government agency or other entity. Consider how the Federal Reserve's target rate of inflation is usually 2%. The Federal Reserve then enacts policies based on CPI measurements to achieve this target. Without this benchmark, analysts and policymakers wouldn't know what makes a good indicator's value good or poor.

The Stock Market As an Indicator

Leading indicators forecast where an economy is headed. One of the top leading indicators is the stock market itself. Though not the most critical leading indicator, it’s the one that most people look at. Because stock prices factor in forward-looking performance, the market can indicate the economy’s direction, if earnings estimates are accurate.

A strong market may suggest that earnings estimates are up, which may suggest overall economic activity is up. Conversely, a down market may indicate that company earnings are expected to suffer. However, there are limitations to the usefulness of the stock market as an indicator because performance to estimates is not guaranteed, so there is a risk.

Also, stocks are subject to price manipulations caused by Wall Street traders and corporations. Manipulations can include inflating stock prices via high-volume trades, complex financial derivative strategies and creative accounting principles—both legal and illegal. The stock market is also vulnerable to the emergence of “bubbles,” which may give a false positive regarding the market’s direction.

If you're particularly interested in a specific economic indicator released monthly by the government, be aware that report is often released on the same day (i.e. second Tuesday) of every month at the same time.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Economic Indicators

Pros of Economic Indicators

Economic indicators rely on data to substantiate predictions of what is to come in the future. When analyzed correctly, investors can capitalize on data to make successful trades or correctly assess future market conditions.

Economic indicators are often free and public, as the United States government prepares many economic indicators. In addition, these economic indicators reported by governments often have a fixed cadence and steady form of measurement. This means you can usually rely on the method of how an indicator was calculated and the timing of when that indicator will be released.

Cons of Economic Indicators

The obvious downside to economic indicators, at least leading or coincident indicators, is that they rely on some degree of forecasting. While leading indicators are projections to the future, even coincident indicators may rely on a bit of assumptions. Therefore, economic indicators do not always predict the future correctly, and the recommended action to take may not play out as expected.

Economic indicators, though boiled down to a single number, can be very complex. For example, consider all of the variables the comprise unemployment. From macroeconomic conditions to weather patterns impacting farming jobs, there may be too many levers that manipulate a given indicator that make it tough to accurately predict what will happen.

Finally, economic indicators are somewhat open to interpretation. Consider an example where inflation has dropped from 4.6% to 4.5%. Is this considered a good change, or should the drop have been larger? Economics and policymakers often debate on the appropriate approach for economic factors. Though data may be concrete, the way to interpret it may lead to various ways evaluating these indicators.

Economic Indicators Pros and Cons

Pros

May accurately forecast what is to come based on prevailing data

Often use publicly available information

May be calculated using the same process over and over (when issued by governments)

May be released on a fixed, predictable cadence

Cons

May not accurately predict the future

Relies on many assumptions, some of which may be unpredictable

Can be open for interpretation, as data may indicate different things

Still requires expertise to interpret and understand the results

What Is the Most Important Economic Indicator?

Every economist may come up with their own favorite economic indicator. For many, a country's GDP usually represents the best overall picture of a country's economic health. It combines the monetary value of every produced in an economy for a certain period, and it considers household consumption, government purchases, and imports/exports.

Is Inflation an Economic Indicator?

Yes, inflation is a lagging indicator that is reported after a rise in prices has occurred. This type of economic indicator is helpful for government agencies to set public policy, as without this type of data, they would not know the direction of the economy. Therefore, while inflation and other lagging indicators are still useful to investors, they are more useful not for the indicator themselves (as they are representative of the past) but for future policy responses.

What Are the Economic Indicators of a Strong Economy?

An economy may be strong if it has a robust amount of economic activity, and job growth. This is measured by low unemployment, steady inflation, increases to construction, positive consumer index readings, and increasing GDP.

Do Traders Use Economic Indicators?

Traders and investment professionals may use economic indicators to predict how broad economic policy will impact their trades or investment strategy. Many trades rely on technical indicators which reflect the detailed movement of specific stocks. Technical indicators are different than economic indicators as economic indicators are much more broad and less security-specific.

The Bottom Line

Economic indicators are leading, coincident, or lagging figures that indicate broad conditions. Economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, or certain prices inform economics, companies, and investors of not only where the economy is today but perhaps where the economy may be headed. Economic indicators can be used to guide government policy or set investment strategies.

Economic indicators

are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Consistent in their release, wide in their scope and range, metrics such as the

Consumer Price Index

(CPI) and written reports like the

Beige Book

are free for all investors to inspect and analyze.

Policymakers, most notably those at the

Federal Reserve

, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going, but how fast it's getting there.

Although investors should get to know economic indicators, the reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw. In other words, information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and

asset allocation

. But there is valuable information in those raw data releases. The various government and nonprofit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, both of which can be very useful to individual investors.

What Is an Economic Indicator?

In its simplest form, an indicator could be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. The U.S. economy is essentially a living thing where, at any given moment, there are billions of moving parts—some acting, others reacting. This simple truth makes predictions extremely difficult. They must always involve a large number of assumptions, no matter what resources are put to the task. But with the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various

economic conditions

. There are also indexes for

coincident indicators

and

lagging indicators

—the components of each are based on whether they tend to rise during or after an economic expansion.﻿

Use in Tandem, Use in Context

Once an investor understands how various indicators are calculated and their

relative strengths

and limitations, several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. For example, in the area of employment, consider using data from several releases. By using the hours-worked data (from the

Employment Cost Index

) along with the

labor report

and

nonfarm payrolls

, investors can get a fairly complete picture of the state of the

labor market

.

Additionally, are increasing retail sales figures being validated by increased personal expenditures? Are new

factory orders

leading to higher factory shipments and higher

durable goods

figures? Are higher wages showing up in higher

personal income

figures? The savvy investor will look up and down the

supply chain

to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release.

Personalizing Your Research

Some people may prefer to understand a couple of specific indicators really well and use this expert knowledge to make investment plays based on their analyses. Others may wish to adopt a jack-of-all-trades approach, understanding the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. For example, a retired couple living on a combination of

pensions

and long-term

Treasury bonds

should be looking for different things than a

stock trader

who rides the waves of the

business cycle

. Most investors fall in the middle, hoping for stock market returns to be steady and near long-term historical averages (about 8% to 10% per year).

Knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful, as well as generally knowing the

macroeconomic

forecasts. Forecast numbers can be found at several public websites, such as Yahoo! Finance or MarketWatch. On the day a specific indicator release is made, there will be

press releases

from newswires such as the Associated Press and Reuters, which will present figures with key pieces highlighted.

It is helpful to read a report on one of the newswires, which may parse the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations,

seasonality

figures, and year-over-year results. For those that use

investment advisors

, these individuals will probably analyze recently released indicators in an upcoming newsletter or discuss them during upcoming meetings.

Inflation Indicators: Keeping a Watchful Eye

Many investors, especially those who invest primarily in

fixed-income securities

, are concerned about

inflation

. Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure. The most notable in this group are the

Producer Price Index

(PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

﻿

﻿﻿ Many investors will use the PPI to try and predict the upcoming CPI.

There is a proven statistical relationship between the two, as economic theory suggests that if producers of goods are forced to pay more in production, some portion of the price increase will be passed on to consumers. Each index is derived independently, but both are released by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics

(BLS). Other key inflationary indicators include the levels and

growth rates

of the

money supply

and the Employment Cost Index (ECI).

﻿

﻿﻿﻿

﻿

﻿﻿

Economic Output: Stock Investors Inquire Within

The

gross domestic product

(GDP) may be the most important indicator out there, especially to equity investors who are focused on

corporate profit

growth. Since the GDP represents the sum of what our economy is producing, its growth rate is targeted to be in certain ranges. If the numbers start to fall outside those ranges, fear of inflation or

recession

will grow in the markets. To get ahead of this fear, many people will follow the monthly indicators that can shed some light on the quarterly GDP report.

For example,

capital goods

shipments from the

Factory Orders Report

are used to calculate producers' durable equipment orders within the GDP report.

Indicators such as

retail sales

and

current account

balances are also used in the computations of GDP, so their release helps to complete part of the economic puzzle prior to the quarterly GDP release.

Other indicators that aren't part of the actual calculations for GDP are still valuable for their predictive abilities. Metrics such as wholesale inventories, the Beige Book, the

Purchasing Managers' Index

(PMI), and the labor report all shed light on how well our economy is functioning. With the assistance of all these monthly data, GDP estimates will begin to tighten up as the component data slowly gets released throughout the quarter. By the time the actual GDP report is released, there will be a general consensus of the figure that is remarkably accurate. If the actual results deviate much from the estimates, the markets will move, often with high

volatility

. If the number falls right into the middle of the expected range, then the markets and investors can collectively pat themselves on the back and let prevailing investing trends continue.

Mark Your Calendar

Sometimes indicators take on a more valuable role because they contain very timely data. The

Institute for Supply Management's

PMI report, for instance, is typically released on the first

business day

of every month.

﻿

﻿﻿ As such, it is one of the first pieces of aggregate data available for the month that just ended. While not as rich in detail as many of the indicators to follow, the category breakdowns are often picked apart for clues to things such as future labor report details (from the employment survey results) or wholesale inventories (inventory survey).

The relative order in which the indicators are presented does not change month to month, so investors may want to mark a few days on their monthly calendars to read up on the areas of the economy that might change how they think about their investments or

time horizon

.

﻿

﻿﻿ Overall, asset allocation decisions can fluctuate over time, and making such changes after a monthly review of macro indicators may be wise.

The Bottom Line

Benchmark pieces of economic indicator data arrive with no agenda or sales pitch. The data just

is,

and that is hard to find these days. By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the

stock market

and the economy in which their dollars are invested, and they can also be better prepared to revisit an

investment thesis

when the timing is right. While there is no one ""magic indicator"" that can dictate whether to buy or sell, using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter

portfolio management

for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor.

What Are Financial Markets?

Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs, including the stock market, bond market, forex market, and derivatives market. Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies.

Key Takeaways

Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs.

There are many kinds of financial markets, including (but not limited to) forex, money, stock, and bond markets.

These markets may include assets or securities that are either listed on regulated exchanges or trade over-the-counter (OTC).

Financial markets trade in all types of securities and are critical to the smooth operation of a capitalist society.

When financial markets fail, economic disruption, including recession and rising unemployment, can result.

Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi

Understanding the Financial Markets

Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of

capitalist economies

by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs. The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings. Financial markets create securities products that provide a return for those with excess funds (investors/lenders) and make these funds available to those needing additional money (borrowers).

The stock market is just one type of financial market. Financial markets are created when people buy and sell financial instruments, including equities, bonds, currencies, and derivatives. Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate.

Some financial markets are small with little activity, and others, like the

New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)

, trade trillions of dollars in securities daily. The equities (stock) market is a financial market that enables investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. The primary stock market is where new issues of stocks are sold. Any subsequent trading of stocks occurs in the secondary market, where investors buy and sell securities they already own.

Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value.

Types of Financial Markets

There are several different types of markets. Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it.

Stock Markets

Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets. These are venues where companies list their shares, which are bought and sold by traders and investors. Stock markets, or equities markets, are used by companies to raise capital and by investors to search for returns.

Stocks may be traded on listed exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),

Nasdaq

, or the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Most stock trading is done via regulated exchanges, which plays an important economic role because it is another way for money to flow through the economy.

Typical participants in a stock market include (both retail and institutional) investors, traders,

market makers (MMs)

, and specialists who maintain liquidity and provide two-sided markets.

Brokers

are third parties that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers but who do not take an actual position in a stock.

Over-the-Counter Markets

An

over-the-counter (OTC)

market is a decentralized market—meaning it does not have physical locations, and trading is conducted electronically—in which market participants trade securities directly (meaning without a broker). While OTC markets may handle trading in certain stocks (e.g., smaller or riskier companies that do not meet the listing criteria of exchanges), most stock trading is done via exchanges. Certain derivatives markets, however, are exclusively OTC, making up an essential segment of the financial markets. Broadly speaking, OTC markets and the transactions that occur in them are far less regulated, less liquid, and more opaque.

Bond Markets

A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate. You may think of a bond as an agreement between the lender and borrower containing the loan's details and its payments. Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. For example, the bond market sells securities such as notes and bills issued by the United States Treasury. The bond market is also called the debt, credit, or fixed-income market.

Money Markets

Typically, the money markets trade in products with highly liquid short-term maturities (less than one year) and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets.

At the wholesale level, the money markets involve large-volume trades between institutions and traders. At the retail level, they include money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers. Individuals may also invest in the money markets by purchasing short-term

certificates of deposit (CDs)

,

municipal notes

, or U.S. Treasury bills, among other examples.

Derivatives Markets

A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). Rather than trading stocks directly, a derivatives market trades in futures and

options

contracts and other advanced financial products that derive their value from underlying instruments like bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes, and stocks.

Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded. Unlike forwards, which trade OTC, futures markets utilize standardized contract specifications, are well-regulated, and use clearinghouses to settle and confirm trades. Options markets, such as the

Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe)

, similarly list and regulate options contracts. Both futures and options exchanges may list contracts on various asset classes, such as equities, fixed-income securities, commodities, and so on.

Forex Market

The

forex (foreign exchange) market

is where participants can buy, sell, hedge, and speculate on the exchange rates between

currency pairs

. The forex market is the most liquid market in the world, as cash is the most liquid of assets. The currency market handles more than $7.5 trillion in daily transactions, more than the futures and equity markets combined.

As with the OTC markets, the forex market is also decentralized and consists of a global network of computers and brokers worldwide. The forex market is made up of banks, commercial companies, central banks, investment management firms, hedge funds, and retail forex brokers and investors.

Commodities Markets

Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as agricultural products (e.g., corn, livestock, soybeans), energy products (oil, gas, carbon credits), precious metals (gold, silver, platinum), or

""soft"" commodities

(such as cotton, coffee, and sugar). These are known as

spot commodity

markets, where physical goods are exchanged for money.

However, the bulk of trading in these commodities takes place on derivatives markets that utilize spot commodities as the underlying assets. Forwards, futures, and options on commodities are exchanged both OTC and on listed

exchanges

around the world, such as the

Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)

and the

Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)

.

Cryptocurrency Markets

Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online

crypto exchanges

. These exchanges host digital wallets for traders to swap one cryptocurrency for another or for fiat monies such as dollars or euros.

Because most crypto exchanges are

centralized

platforms, users are susceptible to hacks or fraudulent activity. Decentralized exchanges are also available that operate without any central authority. These exchanges allow direct peer-to-peer (P2P) trading without an actual exchange authority to facilitate the transactions. Futures and options trading are also available on major cryptocurrencies.

Examples of Financial Markets

The above sections make clear that the ""financial markets"" are broad in scope and scale. To give two more concrete examples, we will consider the role of stock markets in bringing a company to IPO and the role of the OTC derivatives market in the 2008-09 financial crisis.

Stock Markets and IPOs

As a company establishes itself over time and grows, it needs access to additional capital. It will often find itself in need of much larger amounts of capital than it can get from ongoing operations, traditional bank loans, or venture and angel funding. Firms can raise the amount of capital they need by selling shares of itself to the public through an initial public offering (IPO). This changes the company's status from a ""private"" firm whose shares are held by a few shareholders to a

publicly traded

company whose shares will be subsequently held by public investors.

The IPO also offers early investors in the company an opportunity to cash out part of their stake, often reaping very handsome rewards in the process. Initially, the underwriters usually set the IPO price through their pre-marketing process.

Once the company's shares are listed on a

stock exchange

, and trading commences, the price of these shares will fluctuate as investors and traders assess and reassess their intrinsic value and the supply and demand for those shares at any given moment.

OTC Derivatives and the 2008 Financial Crisis: MBS and CDOs

While the 2008-09 financial crisis was caused and made worse by several factors, one factor that has been widely identified is the market for

mortgage-backed securities (MBS)

.

These are OTC derivatives where cash flows from individual mortgages are bundled, sliced up, and sold to investors. The crisis resulted from a sequence of events, each with its own trigger—these events culminated in the banking system's near-collapse. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income consumers, creating a market for

subprime mortgages

.

The amount of subprime mortgage debt guaranteed by

Freddie Mac

and

Fannie Mae

continued to expand into the early 2000s when the Federal Reserve Board began to cut interest rates drastically to avoid a recession.

The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money spurred a housing boom, which drove speculation, pushing up housing prices and creating a real estate bubble. In the meantime, the investment banks, looking for easy profits in the wake of the

dotcom bust

and the 2001 recession, created a type of MBS called

collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)

from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market.

Because subprime mortgages were bundled with prime mortgages, there was no way for investors to understand the risks associated with the product. When the market for CDOs began to heat up, the housing bubble that had been building for several years finally burst. As housing prices fell, subprime borrowers began to default on loans that were worth more than their homes, accelerating the decline in prices.

When investors realized the MBS and CDOs were worthless due to the toxic debt they represented, they attempted to unload the obligations. However, there was no market for the CDOs. The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures created liquidity

contagion

that reached the upper tiers of the banking system. Two major investment banks, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, collapsed under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt, and more than 450 banks failed over the next five years.

Several major banks were on the brink of failure and were rescued by a taxpayer-funded bailout.

What Are the Different Types of Financial Markets?

Some examples of financial markets and their roles include the stock market, the bond market, forex, commodities, and the real estate market, among others. Financial markets can also be broken down into capital markets, money markets, primary vs. secondary markets, and listed vs. OTC markets.

How Do Financial Markets Work?

Despite covering many different asset classes and having various structures and regulations, all financial markets work essentially by bringing together buyers and sellers in some asset or contract and allowing them to trade with one another. This is often done through an auction or

price-discovery

mechanism.

What Are the Main Functions of Financial Markets?

Financial markets exist for several reasons, but the most fundamental function is to allow for the efficient allocation of capital and assets in a financial economy. By allowing a free market for the flow of capital, financial obligations, and money, the financial markets make the global economy run more smoothly while allowing investors to participate in capital gains over time.

The Bottom Line

Financial markets provide liquidity, capital, and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability. Without financial markets, capital could not be allocated efficiently, and economic activity such as commerce and trade, investments, and growth opportunities would be greatly diminished.

Many players make markets an essential part of the economy—firms use stock and bond markets to raise capital from investors. Speculators look to various asset classes to make directional bets on future prices. At the same time,

hedgers

use derivatives markets to mitigate various risks, and

arbitrageurs

seek to take advantage of mispricings or anomalies observed across various markets. Brokers often act as mediators that bring buyers and sellers together, earning a commission or fee for their services.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren popularized the 50/20/30 budget rule in her book,

All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan.

The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings.

This intuitive and straightforward rule can help you draw up a reasonable budget that you can stick to over time in order to meet your financial goals.

Key Takeaways

The rule states that you should spend up to 50% of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do.

The remaining half should be split up between 20% savings and debt repayment and 30% to everything else that you might want.

The rule is a template that is intended to help individuals manage their money and save for emergencies and retirement.

The purpose of the 50/30/20 rule is to balance paying for necessities while being mindful of long-term savings and retirement.

The 50/30/20 rule can be simplified by setting up automatic deposits, using automatic payments, and tracking changes in income.

50%: Needs

Needs are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for survival. Half of your after-tax income should be all that you need to cover your needs and obligations. If you are spending more than that on your needs, you will have to either cut down on wants or try to downsize your lifestyle, perhaps to a smaller home or more modest car. Maybe carpooling or taking public transportation to work is a solution, or cooking at home more often. Examples of ""needs"" include but aren't limited to:

Rent or

mortgage

payments

Car payments

Groceries

Insurance and health care

Minimum debt payments

Utilities

30%: Wants

Wants are all the things you spend money on that are not absolutely essential. Anything in the ""wants"" bucket is optional if you boil it down. You can work out at home instead of going to the gym, cook instead of eating out, or watch sports on TV instead of getting tickets to the game.

This category also includes those upgrade decisions you make, such as choosing a costlier steak instead of a less expensive hamburger, buying a Mercedes instead of a more economical Honda, or choosing between watching television using an antenna for free or spending money to watch cable TV. Basically, wants are all those little extras you spend money on that make life more enjoyable and entertaining. In general, examples of ""wants"" include but aren't limited to:

New unnecessary clothes or accessories like handbags or jewelry

Tickets to sporting events

Vacations or other non-essential travel

The latest electronic gadget (especially an upgrade over a fully functioning prior model)

Ultra-high-speed Internet beyond your streaming needs

20%: Savings

Finally, try to allocate 20% of your net income to savings and investments. You should have at least three months of emergency savings on hand in case you lose your job or an unforeseen event occurs. After that, focus on retirement and meeting other financial goals down the road. Examples of savings could include:

Creating an

emergency fund

Making

IRA contributions

to a

mutual fund

account

Investing in the stock market

Setting aside funds to buy physical property for long-term holding

Making debt repayments beyond minimum payments

If emergency funds are ever used, the first allocation of additional income should be to replenish the emergency fund account.

Importance of Savings

Americans are notoriously bad at saving, and the nation has extremely high levels of debt. As of August 2023, the average personal savings rate for individuals in the United States was just 3.9%.

The 50-20-30 rule is intended to help individuals manage their after-tax income, primarily to have funds on hand for emergencies and savings for

retirement

. Every household should prioritize creating an emergency fund in case of job losses, unexpected medical expenses, or any other unforeseen monetary cost. If an emergency fund is used, then a household should focus on replenishing it.

Saving for retirement is also a critical step as individuals are living longer. Calculating how much you will need for retirement and working towards that goal, beginning at a young age will ensure a comfortable retirement.

Benefits of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

The 50/30/20 rule can guide individuals to financial prosperity in a number of different ways. Potential benefits from these guidelines include:

Ease of Use:

The 50/30/20 rule offers a straightforward framework for budgeting, making it simple to comprehend and apply. You may distribute your income immediately without the need for intricate calculations. This makes it so even the least financially-savvy person can still adhere to these rules.

Enact Financial Balance:

By using a budget, you may manage your money in a balanced way. You may make sure that your necessary costs are covered, that you have money for

discretionary spending

, and that you're actively saving for the future. In this way, you'll be able to save for the future, save for current needs, and still have a little fun with finances.

Prioritize Vital Expenses:

You can make sure that you cover your fundamental needs without going over budget or taking on too much debt by giving these basics top priority. As these rules stipulate that half of your budget goes towards needs, this plan makes sure your essentials are more likely to be met.

Emphasize Saving Goals:

By allocating 20% of your income to savings, you can set up an emergency fund, prepare for retirement, pay off debt, invest, or pursue other financial goals. By consistently saving this amount, you establish sound financial practices and build a safety net for unforeseen costs or future goals.

Promote Long-Term Financial Security:

Using these rules, you give your financial future priority by continuously setting aside 20% of your salary. This expenditure on savings can help you accumulate money, meet long-term financial objectives, and give yourself and your family a sense of security as you approach retirement in either the short-term or long-term timeframe.

The idea behind the 50/30/20 rule is that anyone can use these proportions, regardless of their income. However, be mindful how those with lower income or those living in higher cost of living areas may need to adjust these percentages.

How to Adopt the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

No single way of tracking to a budget will work for everyone. However, here are some high-level tips on adopting a 50/30/20 budget relevant to all individuals.

Track Your Expenses

To better understand your spending habits, start by keeping track of your expenses for a month or two. Analyze your spending to determine how well it adheres to the 50/30/20 breakdown by classifying it into needs, wants, and savings. This will set the groundwork for better understanding how far off from budget you will be starting off at. Also, the only way you'll know you're being successful at adhering to this budget is by tracking your actual spend. Most often, this can be done fairly easy using spreadsheet solutions such as

Microsoft Excel

.

Understanding Your Income

The basis of the 50/30/20 budget is rooted in understanding what your income is. Take caution that your gross income may be vastly different from your net income as Federal income taxes reduce what you'll take home. By understanding what you earn and what actually hits your bank account each pay period, you'll be better positioned to establish the correct budget amounts for the three categories.

Identify Your Critical Costs

This includes expenses such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, transportation expenses, insurance premiums, and debt repayments. These costs are non-negotiable, and these must be expenses necessary for your daily living. Because these expenses may take up the largest portion of your budget, it's important to be most mindful with this group. In addition, these expenses must be incurred, so you likely have the least amount of flexibility once they are committed to. For example, locking into a

rental agreement

may require a six-month or 12-month requirement.

Automate Your Savings

By automating the process, saving will be simpler. Set up monthly automated payments from your checking account to your investment or savings accounts. This guarantees that your funds increase steadily without requiring manual labor. This may also make it easier to regularly review your budget to make sure it is in line with your lifestyle and financial objectives as there is less of a burden to administratively manage your savings.

Maintain Consistency

Adopting the 50/30/20 budget guideline successfully requires maintaining consistency. Over time, stick to your spending strategy and resisted the want to go over budget or depart from your percentage allocations. Like any other form of budget, this plan is often most successful when there are clear guidelines that can leveraged every month. Be mindful to reset your spending limits each month, and strive to maintain consistency from one period to the next.

Example of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule

Imagine a person recently graduated from college and started her first full-time job. She wants to develop good financial habits from the beginning and has heard about the 50/30/20 budget rule. Eager to take control of her finances, she decides to set up a 50/30/20 budget.

To understand her spending patterns, the person starts tracking her expenses for a month. She uses a budgeting app that categorizes her expenses automatically into needs, wants, and savings. The person calculates her monthly

after-tax income

, which amounts to $3,500. This will be her basis for allocating her budget according to the 50/30/20 rule.

After analyzing her tracked expenses, the person realizes that her essential expenses like rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and student loan payments add up to approximately $1,750 per month. She allocates exactly 50% of her income, which is $1,750, to cover these needs. The person then allocates $1,050 to discretionary items and $700 each month to retirement and savings. The person sets up an automatic transfer from her checking account to her savings account on her payday.

Six months later, the person is promoted. Because the person's income has changed, she reevaluates each budget amount. In addition, the person reviews her budget and adjusts as needed. She also realizes that her transportation expenses are higher than expected, so she decides to start carpooling with a colleague to reduce costs.

The person remains disciplined and consistent with her budgeting practice. She prioritizes financial well-being and regularly evaluates her progress toward her goals. As she progresses in her career, she continues to adjust her budget to reflect changes in her income and priorities. In the long run, the person has taken steps to not only have their needs met but have sufficient funds available for their future.

Can I Modify the Percentages in the 50/30/20 Rule to Fit My Circumstances?

Yes, you can modify the percentages in the 50/30/20 rule based on your circumstances and priorities. Adjusting the percentages can help you tailor the rule to better suit your financial goals and needs. This is especially relevant for people living in places with higher cost of living or for people that have loftier, higher long-term retirement saving needs.

Should I Include Taxes in the Calculation of the 50/30/20 Rule?

Taxes are typically excluded from the calculation of the 50%, 30%, 20% rule since it focuses on allocating income after taxes. You should consider your after-tax income when applying the rule. If you do decide to factor in taxes, be mindful to use gross income and appropriately forecast what your taxes will be.

How Can I Budget Effectively Using the 50/30/20 Rule?

To budget effectively using the 50%, 30%, 20% rule, track your expenses, prioritize essential needs, be mindful of wants, and consistently allocate savings or debt repayment within the designated percentage.

Can I Use the 50/30/20 Rule to Save for Long-Term Goals?

Yes, the 50/30/20 rule can be used to save for long-term goals. Allocate a portion of the 20% to savings specifically for your long-term goals, such as a down payment on a house, education funds, or investments. The rule is intentionally meant to bring focus to savings.

The Bottom Line

Saving is difficult, and life often throws unexpected expenses at us. By following the 50-20-30 rule, individuals have a plan with how they should manage their after-tax income. If they find that their expenditures on wants are more than 30%, they can find ways to reduce those expenses that will help direct funds to more important areas such as emergency money and retirement.

Life should be enjoyed, and it is not recommended to live like a Spartan, but having a plan and sticking to it will allow you to cover your expenses, save for retirement, all at the same time doing the activities that make you happy.

What Is an Emergency Fund?

The term “emergency fund” refers to money stashed away that people can use in times of

financial distress

. The purpose of an emergency fund is to improve financial security by creating a safety net that can be used to meet unanticipated expenses, such as an illness or major home repairs.

Assets in an emergency fund tend to be cash or other highly

liquid assets

. This reduces the need to either draw from high-interest debt options, such as

credit cards

or

unsecured loans

, or undermine your future security by tapping into

retirement funds

.

Spanish Translation of Emergency Fund

Key Takeaways

An emergency fund is a financial safety net for future mishaps and/or unexpected expenses.

Emergency funds should typically have three to six months’ worth of expenses, although the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown has led some experts to suggest up to one year’s worth.

Individuals should keep their emergency funds in accounts that are easily accessible and easily liquidated.

Savers can use tax refunds and other windfalls to build up their funds.

Some employers have established programs to encourage emergency fund saving.

Understanding Emergency Funds

You establish an emergency fund when you put away money that is intended to be used during times of financial hardship. This includes the loss of your job, a debilitating illness, or a major repair to your home or car—not to mention the kind of major economic crisis and lockdown

that happened in 2020

.

The best size for an emergency fund depends on a number of factors, including your financial situation, expenses, lifestyle, and

debts

. Many financial advisors recommend saving enough to cover anywhere from three to six months’ worth of expenses, which can help you weather a modest healthcare bill or a short bout of unemployment.

However, some experts argue for an even heftier cushion. Celebrity finance guru Suze Orman, for example, suggests an emergency fund that can handle up to eight months’ worth of outlays.

And she made that contention well before the 2020 crisis, a stark reminder of how sudden and deep an economic slump can be.

Individual circumstances may dictate the specific savings level with which you’re comfortable. For example, a single adult without children may be content covering three months of expenses, while the sole

breadwinner

for an entire family may want to have enough to cover half a year or more.

Research shows that many Americans are well short of the recommended range. In fact, a 2020 survey by the

Federal Reserve

found that more than one-fourth of Americans lacked the ability to cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalents. Among unemployed workers, that figure rose to 45%.

If you’re

living paycheck to paycheck

, you may want to start with more modest goals, such as putting 2% of your net income into a rainy day fund and slowly increasing your contribution rate every few months. Even a modest safety net can help buy you a little time should you face an unforeseen financial crisis.

It may be tempting to use your fund for incidental or frivolous purposes, so make sure that you don’t deplete this resource for any purpose other than an actual emergency.

How to Build an Emergency Fund

Starting early is the key to setting up an emergency fund, because it helps you build up a comfortable cushion against unexpected emergencies later in life.

Getting a start on emergency funds is relatively easy. Here are two simple ways to begin saving for one.

Set aside a comfortable amount from your salary each month.

Calculate your living expenses for the desired period, and make that your target for an emergency fund. You can then divert a portion of your paycheck—perhaps by setting up an

automatic transfer

—to that account each month. Once the fund is built up, invest extra savings for the long term or other goals, such as the down payment on a mortgage.

Once you’ve maxed out your retirement savings

, that money could go into an investment account with higher risks and rewards.

Save your tax refund.

You may be tempted to think of a tax refund or stimulus check as extra money for discretionary spending. Instead, consider diverting it toward your emergency fund to give you an added financial cushion.

You probably want to park your emergency fund in a vehicle that can be easily

liquidated

should a financial need suddenly arise. While storing cash in a savings account may be the safest approach, there are other relatively

secure ways to store a part of your emergency fund

that offer greater interest-earning potential. These include

high-interest savings accounts

,

money market accounts

, and no-penalty

certificates of deposit (CDs)

, which don’t charge savers a fee if they need to pull their money out before the maturity date.

You’ll have the access you need in an emergency but won’t be incurring fees and time delays associated with other vehicles, such as

brokerage accounts

.

You may want to

build an emergency fund

before venturing into volatile investment vehicles such as stocks. The latter offer greater long-term growth potential than cash and

cash equivalents

, but their value can suddenly decrease in the event of an economic downturn, as the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown made vividly clear. Should that be the moment when you need to tap them, you could lose more value. An emergency fund protects your

portfolio

against that risk.

Helping Employees Save

A number of major employers have introduced programs encouraging emergency savings because of the effects of financial instability on

productivity

and retirement security. Here’s a sampling of programs from three major companies.

Truist Financial Corp.:

Through its Truist Momentum program, the parent of SunTrust and BB&T banks offers $750 to employees who complete an eight-part financial education program, then open and fund an emergency savings account. More than 48,000 employees have graduated as of Aug. 6, 2021, according to the company.

Levi Strauss & Co.:

The apparel brand gives hourly employees up to $240 each in

matching funds

through its Red Tab Foundation when they make qualifying contributions to their savings accounts over a six-month period. Workers also receive a $20 bonus when they link their bank account to the company’s online platform.

Prudential Financial Inc.:

Retirement plans administered by Prudential allow employees to divert part of their paycheck toward a savings account, encouraging them to create a financial safety net. This feature serves as after-tax emergency savings and allows employees to withdraw the funds if an emergency arises, while preserving their before-tax retirement contributions.

Example of an Emergency Fund

Here’s a hypothetical example showing how to assemble an emergency fund. Let’s say a married couple has monthly expenses totaling $5,000. This includes the couple’s mortgage payments, food bills, car payments, and other necessary outlays. Using the three-month rule, the couple needs to set aside at least $15,000 (or $30,000 for six months and $40,000 for eight months) to address any unexpected financial burdens.

How much should I have in an emergency fund?

The amount varies according to your living expenses, but the general rule of thumb is to eventually save three to six months of living expenses.

How can I create an emergency fund if I am living paycheck to paycheck?

It won’t be easy, but instead of worrying about your eventual savings amount, decide on a percentage of take-home pay that you can do without. It can be 1% or 2%. The important thing is to save a set amount each payday and not touch it. The money will add up.

What is an emergency fund for?

As simple as the answer seems, it is important to make sure that you can distinguish between what is an emergency and what isn’t. An emergency is an unexpected bill that you can’t pay—not money to go to a movie or for some other nonessential expense.

If you're just getting started with investing, here's what you need to know.

If you've decided to start investing -- congratulations! By setting aside some of your money now in investments that could appreciate over time, you'll set yourself up for greater financial security in the future.

Now that you've decided that you want to invest, it's important to devote some time to learning

how

to invest. With that in mind, here are some basic concepts you should know before you get started.

Image source: Getty Images.

Why should I invest?

The easy answer to the question is: to create wealth. As a whole,

stock investments

have historically returned more than 9% per year, on average. If you invested $10,000 at this return rate for 40 years, it would grow to nearly $315,000.

Investing can help you reach your financial goals, such as paying for your children's

college education

, passing wealth to loved ones, or building a nest egg for your own

retirement

. There are many potential

reasons to invest money

.

How much should you invest?

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Including

retirement accounts

, I generally suggest that you should aim to invest at least 10% of your income. In other words, if you contribute 4% of your salary to your 401(k), it could be a good goal to set aside 6% of your income to invest on your own.

The important thing is that you start as soon as possible, and make it a habit. When I started investing, I had $100 transferred into

my brokerage account

from every paycheck, automatically. This may not sound like much, but it sure can add up over time. You may be surprised at the

long-term impact

you can make by investing a seemingly

small amount of money

while you're young.

The basic types of investments

There are hundreds of things you can invest in, ranging from stocks and bonds to artwork and collectible coins. For our purposes, we're going to focus on investments you can choose in your brokerage account, or in your retirement plan at work. These generally include:

Stocks

: Also known as equities, stocks represent partial ownership of one or more companies. If a company does well, the stock can increase in value. Stocks have high return potential over long time periods but tend to be

more volatile

than other investments.

Bonds

: Also known as fixed-income investments, bonds are designed to create a steady stream of income. While bond values are somewhat

vulnerable to interest-rate

fluctuations, bonds are generally more stable than stocks, but with lower return potential.

Cash:

In addition to physical cash, this category includes

investments like CDs

,

money-market accounts

, and savings accounts. Cash investments have the lowest risk, but also the lowest return potential.

Mutual funds and ETFs

:

Mutual funds

and

exchange-traded funds

pool money from many investors and then invest it in an assortment of stocks, bonds, or other investments. For example, an

S&P 500

ETF

would invest in all 500 stocks that make up the index.

Asset allocation: Stocks vs. bonds vs. cash

Since stocks are highly volatile but have the most return potential, they are more appropriate for younger investors. In contrast, bonds are designed for predictability, making them better for older investors with lower risk tolerance. Cash investments are typically not a good idea unless you have lots of near-term liquidity needs. Determining the

appropriate asset allocation

for your investment strategy is a critical step to take.

Should I invest actively or passively?

There are two main methods of investing. Active investment refers to picking individual stocks and bonds or buying mutual funds that are actively managed by professionals. In other words, an active investor's goal is to

beat

the market.

On the other hand, passive investing means simply trying to match the market's performance, generally through

funds that track indexes

. For example, an S&P 500 ETF (mentioned in the prior section) is a passive investment vehicle.

The question you need to answer is how much time you want to spend on investing. If you have the time and desire to research individual stocks, active investment could be the way to go. If not, there's nothing wrong with passive investing. In fact, billionaire investor Warren Buffett believes that passive investing is the

best way to go

for many people.

How to choose stocks to invest in

If you choose to invest in individual stocks, the first thing you should understand is the difference between investing and speculating. Investing is a long-term activity, designed to achieve sustained returns that can

compound over time

. Speculating is akin to gambling -- trying to chase a quick payday.

With that in mind, there are certain types of stocks that make excellent long-term investments,

especially for beginners

. There are many things to look for in

your first stock investments

, but just to name a few: You'll want to

learn

basic ways to value stocks, identify durable

competitive advantages

, and understand how a business makes money. Of course, our writers at The Motley Fool regularly suggest some good beginner stocks, like

these examples

.

How to get started

Once you've learned the basics, and you've come up with your game plan, the next step is to

open a brokerage account

and put your plan into action. Be sure to shop around, as different brokerages charge different fees and offer different features. As a new investor, you'll want a brokerage which offers access to investment research and educational features, in order to help with stock selection and to answer any questions you might have along the way.

Investing Basics

Risk

All investments carry some degree of risk.

Stocks

,

bonds

,

mutual funds

and

exchange-traded funds

can lose value—even their entire value—if market conditions sour. Even conservative, insured investments, such as

certificates of deposit (CDs)

issued by a bank or credit union, come with inflation risk. That is, they may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.

What Is Risk?

When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to negatively impact your financial welfare.

For example, your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions (market risk). Corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company, can affect the value of your investments (business risk). If you own an international investment, events within that country can affect your investment (political risk and currency risk, to name two).

There are other types of risk. How easy or hard it is to cash out of an investment when you need to is called

liquidity risk

. Another risk factor is tied to how many or how few investments you hold. Generally speaking, the more financial eggs you have in one basket, say all your money in a single stock, the greater risk you take (

concentration risk

).

In short, risk is the possibility that a negative financial outcome that matters to you might occur.

There are several key concepts you should understand when it comes to investment risk.

Risk and Reward

The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class typically correlates with the level of return the investment might achieve. The rationale behind this relationship is that investors willing to take on risky investments and potentially lose money should be rewarded for their risk.

You can learn about risks associated with specific investments by going to the Risk tab for each investment listed in our

Investment Products

section.

In the context of investing, reward is the possibility of higher returns. Historically, stocks have enjoyed the most robust average annual returns over the long term (just over 10 percent per year), followed by corporate bonds (around 6 percent annually), Treasury bonds (5.5 percent per year) and cash/cash equivalents such as short-term Treasury bills (3.5 percent per year). The tradeoff is that with this higher return comes greater risk.

And although stocks have historically provided a higher return than bonds and cash investments (albeit, at a higher level of risk), it's not always the case that stocks outperform bonds or that bonds are always lower risk than stocks.

Time Can Be Your Friend or Foe

Based on historical data, holding a broad portfolio of stocks over an extended period of time (for instance a large-cap portfolio like the S&P 500 over a 20-year period) significantly reduces your chances of losing your principal. However, the historical data should not mislead investors into thinking that there is no risk in investing in stocks over a long period of time.

For example, suppose an investor invests $10,000 in a broadly diversified stock portfolio and 19 years later sees that portfolio grow to $20,000. The following year, the investor’s portfolio loses 20 percent of its value, or $4,000, during a market downturn. As a result, at the end of the 20-year period, the investor ends up with a $16,000 portfolio, rather than the $20,000 portfolio she held after 19 years. Money was made—but not as much as if shares were sold the previous year. That’s why stocks are always risky investments, even over the long-term. They don’t get safer the longer you hold them.

This is not a hypothetical risk. If you had planned to retire in the 2008 to 2009 timeframe—when stock prices dropped by 57 percent—and had the bulk of your retirement savings in stocks or stock mutual funds, you might have had to reconsider your retirement plan.

Investors should also consider how realistic it will be for them to ride out the ups and downs of the market over the long-term. Will you have to sell stocks during an economic downturn to fill the gap caused by a job loss? Will you sell investments to pay for medical care or a child’s college education? Predictable and unpredictable life events might make it difficult for some investors to stay invested in stocks over an extended period of time.

Managing Risk

You cannot eliminate investment risk. But two basic investment strategies—

asset allocation and diversification

—can help manage both systemic risk (risk affecting the economy as a whole) and non-systemic risk (risks that affect a small part of the economy, or even a single company).

Hedging (buying a security to offset a potential loss on another investment) and insurance products can provide additional ways to manage risk. However, both strategies typically add (often significantly) to the costs of your investment, which can eat away at returns. In addition, hedging typically involves speculative, higher risk activity such as short selling (buying or selling securities you don't own), trading in complex products such as

options

or investing in illiquid securities.

The bottom line is that all investments carry some degree of risk. By better understanding the nature of risk, and taking steps to manage those risks, you put yourself in a better position to meet your financial goals.

How to convert to a Roth IRA online

If your employer offers a retirement plan, like a 401(k) or 403(b), and will match a percentage of your contributions, you should definitely take advantage of it—after all, it's free money for you. Plus you'll have a tax-deferred account that makes saving a cinch through automatic payroll deduction.

If your employer doesn't offer a plan, then an IRA can be a good start to your retirement savings and another opportunity for your earnings to grow tax-free.

Facts & figures you need to know

401(k)

IRA

Who can participate

Anyone who works for an employer that offers a plan

Effective for 2020 contributions and later, anyone with earned income can open and contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2019 contributions and earlier, you could not make contributions to a traditional IRA after age 70½.

How much you can invest

If you're under age 50

, your annual contribution limit is $20,500 for 2022 and $22,500 for 2023.

If you're age 50 or older

, your annual contribution limit is $27,000 for 2022 and $30,000 for 2023.

If you're under age 50

, your annual contribution limit is $6,000 for 2022 and $6,500 for 2023.

If you're age 50 or older

, your annual contribution limit is $7,000 for 2022 and $7,500 for 2023.

Get details on IRA contribution limits & deadlines

What you can invest in

Most employers limit you to a preselected list of investment choices.

You can invest in a wide variety of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and individual stocks and bonds.

Pick investments for your IRA

How to get started

Your employer may automatically enroll you in the plan and offer you an easy way to contribute through automatic payroll deduction.

You can open an IRA on your own through almost any bank, brokerage company, insurance firm, or investment company.

Learn how to open your IRA

Eligible for both? Go for it

The good news is that you don't necessarily have to think IRA versus 401(k). You can save with both as long as you're qualified and heed contribution and income limits.

Learn how an IRA and a 401(k) can work together

If you're eligible to invest in a 401(k) and an IRA, here's an efficient way to do it:

Enroll in your company's 401(k) and contribute at least the amount that your employer will match.

Contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA.

Go back to your 401(k) plan and contribute beyond the match to the annual maximum allowed, if possible.

We recommend following these steps because an IRA offers more flexibility and choice, giving you a greater chance to diversify your assets and reduce your investment risk.

All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account.

Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

When taking withdrawals from an IRA before age 59½, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax."

Here's a decade-by-decade guide to retirement planning

Hitting key milestones at early ages can get you in solid financial shape for retirement. Saving in 401(k) plans, and individual retirement accounts can help.

How to read this guide

Follow along from start to finish, or jump to the section(s) you want to learn more about.

Introduction

Saving for retirement is the gnarliest of delayed gratification challenges. Tucking money away today in retirement accounts with the intention you won't touch it for decades is not a habit that most brains are hard-wired to embrace.

But save we must.

For most people,

Social Security

benefits won't cover all the bills in retirement. To land in retirement in solid financial shape, you also want to build your own savings in 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts.

It's never too early to get started. (Hint: compound growth is your best investing friend.) Nor is it ever too late to make progress. (Another hint: Worried you won't have enough retirement income? Consider ways to reduce your spending needs in retirement.)

Like any big goal, breaking it down into manageable bite-size pieces keeps the task from veering into overwhelming. Focusing on a few key moves in each decade will set you up for a successful retirement.

Here's how much money you should have saved now

In your 20s: Cash in on compound growth

Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:

You should aim to save about 1x your salary

Yes, you've got a lot of competing goals and, yes, retirement is a long way off. Understood. But the powerful math of

compound growth

means this is the decade where what you manage to save can exploit compound growth to its fullest.

Aim to save 10% of your gross salary pronto.

That's a minimum; crank it up to 15% and you're giving yourself a serious leg up. If you wait another decade to get rolling, you'll need to save at least 20%.

Focus on Roth options.

Retirement accounts come in two flavors: traditional and Roth. The big difference is when you pay tax. At this life stage, when you've yet to hit peak earnings,

saving in a Roth

can be smart.

Traditional IRA versus Roth IRA

Your Money

Got a workplace plan? Check what your employer chose for you.

If your employer auto-enrolled you into a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b), chances are your contribution rate was set way too low. Some plans start you at a rate that doesn't even enable you to pocket the matching maximum contribution most plans offer. And most plans choose an initial contribution rate that even with the maximum match won't get you near your 10% target. No worries. You can easily change your contribution rate. Ping HR.

No workplace plan?

Get rolling with an IRA.

If you're self-employed, or a contract worker, you can set up an IRA account at any discount brokerage. If you

qualify for a Roth IRA

, your maximum contribution in 2020 is $6,000. Able to save more? Check out a

SEP-IRA

; it allows self-employed workers to save more for retirement. Alas, SEPs only are traditional. There's no Roth option with a SEP.

Check out a target date fund.

If you're flummoxed by all the investment choices, a TDF can handle the work for you. A TDF automatically chooses a mix of stocks and bonds deemed appropriate based on how long you've got until you expect to retire.

How to Pick the Best Retirement Plan

.

An illustration of a person in her 30's holding a phone that displays her spending breakdown, including savings, dining out, shopping, friends, vacations, and rent.

Josephine Flood | CNBC

In your 30s: Stay (or get) focused

Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:

You should aim to save about

3x your salary

If you're just getting started, aim to save at least 15% of your gross salary

;

20% is even better.

You don't have time for baby steps at this point. If you can't imagine immediately revving from zero to at least 15%, that's a sign it's time to — deep breath — commit to

budgeting

to find the cash to save.

Hands off what you have already saved for retirement.

If you contributed to a workplace retirement plan in your 20s, don't blow it by cashing out when you job hop. An unfortunate feature of workplace plans is that when you leave a job, one of your options is to cash out your retirement account. To be blunt: That's a crazy-bad move. There may be taxes, and there definitely will be a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Moreover, you've just robbed your future self of money you will need in retirement.

In your 40s: Monitor your spending

Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:

You should aim to save about

4x your salary

The challenge in this decade is to not take on big-ticket spending that can make it hard to keep up with your retirement plan.

Get a ballpark of how you're doing.

After a decade (or, it's hoped, two) of saving for retirement, it's a good time to plug in what you've got saved up into an online calculator to get a rough estimate of what that might grow to by the time you're ready to retire. If the numbers give you pause, you've got time to crank up the saving. Can't see your way to do that? Keep reading.

Be on high alert for lifestyle creep.

One of the challenges of moving into your prime earning years is the tendency to spend more as you make more.

Lifestyle creep

has upended many a well-intentioned retirement plan. These are the years where buying the less expensive cars, taking the restorative vacations that don't break the bank and checking your tendency to always choose upgrades for whatever you're buying are all conscious ways to spend less so you have more to save.

It's also helpful to

commit to a strategy

for how much of every raise, bonus and one-off windfall, such as an inheritance, you will plunk into your retirement savings accounts.

Don't back up the truck for college.

This is a decidedly hard notion to consider, but insanely important. Ultimately what your kids really need from you is to be able to take care of yourself in retirement, so they don't need to chip in, at a point in their lives when they are likely in the throes of raising their own family. Start the college planning early, and focus on schools where your kid has a good shot at aid that will keep your family's

net price

manageable.

Josephine Flood | CNBC

In your 50s: Plan your retirement income

Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:

You should aim to save about

8x your salary

Saving as much as possible remains Job One. But now's also the time to start getting a sense of how the pieces of your retirement income puzzle will fit together.

Estimate your retirement income.

Online calculators will give you a ballpark of the income your retirement savings can generate over a 30-year retirement. (Yes, you should plan that long. More on this in the next decade). You'll also be asked to plug in an estimate of your Social Security payout. You're too close to retirement to spitball this.

Take a few minutes to log in to the

Social Security Retirement Estimator

to get estimates based on your earnings history. Scribble down what you might qualify for at your full retirement age (somewhere between 66 and 67) and if you wait until age 70. Plug those into the retirement calculator to see how it impacts your retirement income.

Put downsizing on the table.

If the first pass at estimating your retirement savings caused some serious agita, convincing yourself you will just work longer can be

dangerous magical thinking

, especially when a recession hits.

Downsizing sooner than later

can transform your retirement outlook from nerve-wracking to flush.

Save even more.

Once you turn 50, Uncle Sam allows you to save even more in 401(k) plans and IRAs. The catch-up contribution for 401(k) accounts is $6,000 per year. For IRAs, you can add another $1,000.

Get a pro's input

. Head spinning a bit? That's understandable. Saving for retirement is the easy part. Figuring out how to live off your savings and optimize Social Security is anything but. There are plenty of certified financial planners who work on an hourly or project basis to help you sort through your retirement options and hatch a plan.

You've rounded the bend, with retirement in your sights. The big win this decade is to assume that you will live until 95.

Plan on a 30-year retirement.

Tune out the life expectancy numbers that make it into the news from time to time. That's the average from birth. What matters now is your life expectancy from where you're at today. Make it into your 60s and there's a good chance you will still be alive in your 90s. The Society of Actuaries'

Longevity Illustrator

may be the most important retirement planning tool at this life stage. Take a spin through the free tool to get a sense of how long you may need your retirement income plan to last.

Respect inflation.

With a potential 30-plus year retirement runway, you likely will want to keep some of your investment portfolio invested in stocks, which historically provide the best inflation-beating gains. Even at a low 1.5% annual inflation rate, what costs you $1,000 today will cost nearly $1,350 in 20 years and more than $1,550 in 30 years.

Wait until age 70 to start collecting Social Security

. The best investment move you can make in your 60s is to plan to delay taking Social Security. You can start as early as age 62, but you will get 25% to 30% less than if you wait until your FRA, when you are entitled to 100% of your earned benefit. Manage to delay past your FRA and your benefit will increased a guaranteed 8% each year until you reach 70.

Might you earn more if you took the payout earlier and invested in stocks? Perhaps. But you could also lose plenty, too. The

higher payout from delaying when you start Social Security

is guaranteed. For couples in good health, the strategy should be for the highest earner to delay until 70. It is less important when the other spouse claims.

Consider covering essential spending from guaranteed sources of income.

If your Social Security benefit won't cover all your fixed expenses (and you don't have a pension), a

single premium income annuity

can close the gap and make it easier to sleep at night, knowing you've got what you need regardless of what is going on in the markets.

How to get a handle on debt

English

Español

By 

                Courtney-Rose Dantus

There are many steps both big and small to getting a handle on your debt. If you’re unsure where to turn for help or who to trust, you’re not alone. We estimate that about

one in three people

have been contacted by a creditor or collector seeking to collect a debt within the past year.

No matter your reasons for changing your financial situation, there are resources available to help you pay off what you owe. If you want to take steps toward any of your financial goals, we’re here to help.

Consider working with a credit counselor

Credit counselors can advise you on ways to manage your money and debt and help you create and follow a budget, which can help you save or pay off a debt.

Credit counselors

are usually nonprofit organizations. To get started, you can try the

Financial Counseling Association of America

online or by phone at (800) 450-1794, or the

National Foundation for Credit Counseling

online or by phone at (800) 388-2227.

Then, check on the organization with your

state’s attorney general

or your

local consumer protection agency

.

A counselor may:

Offer

free educational materials

and workshops

Review

your budget

and come up with a plan to address your money problems

Help you decide which debts to pay first and understand what can happen if you stop making payments

Make an up-front agreement with your creditors to stop collections and not charge you late fees while you are in a debt management program

Develop a debt management plan

A credit counselor can help you develop a

debt management plan

for some or all of your debts. You may make one payment to the credit counseling organization each month or pay period to use toward payments to your creditors, which may help you focus on your other financial goals.

Credit counselors usually don’t try to reduce the amount of debt you owe. But they may be able to help lower your payments by having you make payments over a longer period, or they may get your creditors to lower your interest rate.

Beware of debt settlement companies that charge up-front fees in return for promising to settle your debts

Debt settlement companies

are different from

nonprofit credit counseling organizations

. These companies often claim they can make a deal with your creditors to reduce the amount of debt you owe. Beware of companies that charge up-front fees. Charging a fee before settling at least one of your debts is illegal for most debt settlement companies. Dealing with debt settlement companies can be risky; you may end up in more debt than when you started. That’s because many debt settlement companies:

Tell you to stop paying your creditors

Tell you they will negotiate with your creditors on your behalf

What they may not tell you is that not paying your debts while trying to settle them can lower your credit scores, add late fees and interest to your account, or cause creditors or debt collectors to file lawsuits against you. These can all slow your momentum toward financial growth.

You should avoid doing business with any debt settlement company that:

Charges any fees before it settles your debts

Tells you to stop communicating with your creditors

Guarantees it can make your debt go away

Tells you it can stop all debt collection calls and lawsuits

Promises you that it can settle all of your debt for a percentage reduction

Promotes a ""new government program"" to bail out personal credit card debt

Guarantees that your unsecured debts can be paid off for pennies on the dollar

You can check on the debt settlement company with your

state’s attorney general

or your

local consumer protection agency

.

Paying off debt can be a long journey. But using this information can get you on track to achieve your financial goals.

We have additional information about working with

debt collectors

, including sample letters you can use for your own situation. You can also

submit a complaint

about a debt collection issue or call us toll-free at (855) 411-CFPB (2372), Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET.

Personal Finance

There are several options for paying off

debt

, and that can sometimes feel overwhelming. You might be thinking about a DIY strategy combined with budgeting and side hustles to increase your income. Maybe you’re contemplating debt consolidation or feel you need to check out debt relief options.

Here’s how to choose a strategy, and some tools and tips that can help you get out of debt.

Assess your debt load

To a large extent, the best way to get out of debt will depend on how much you owe compared with your income.

Start by understanding whether you simply have

too much debt

. That gives you an idea of whether you can use a DIY strategy for payoff or should consider debt relief options.

The calculator below compares the amount you owe on key debt types, and compares it to your gross annual income (total pay before taxes or deductions).

Weigh DIY payoff methods

Debt snowball:

With this strategy for getting out of debt, you focus on paying off your smallest balance first. Put all the extra money you can dedicate to debt payoff toward that account while continuing to pay the minimums on the others.

When that debt is wiped out, add the amount you'd been paying on it to the minimum payment on the next largest debt. The amount you’re paying on the focus debt keeps growing like a snowball getting larger as you roll it.

Debt avalanche:

Focus on the debt with the highest interest rate first (while paying minimums on the others), then the next highest rate and so on.

This might save you money over the long run by wiping out the costliest debt first. But depending on the balance, it might take a while to zero out that first debt. If quicker wins would motivate you, snowball may be a better method.

Focus on high credit utilization:

You could also focus on paying down your credit cards with the highest

credit utilization

— the highest percentage of the credit limit being used. Credit utilization plays a big role in your credit score, so in this case paying down debt could have a side benefit of helping your score.

Consider debt consolidation to get out of debt faster

Debt consolidation

takes your high-interest debt, like credit card balances, and rolls them into one monthly payment, ideally at a lower interest rate. Some potential benefits of consolidating your debt include:

Lowering your interest rate.

Making your payments more manageable.

Shortening the time it takes to pay off your debt.

You might be able to use a

balance transfer credit card

or a

debt consolidation loan

, but note that you’ll likely need a good credit score to qualify. Each lender sets its own requirements, but generally scores of 690 or higher count as

good credit scores

.

It’s also possible to borrow from your

401(k)

or to consider using some of your

home equity

to pay debt — but be aware that you risk your retirement savings and your home in those cases.

Boost debt payoff with budgeting

If you feel like you don’t have enough money to cut down debt, getting clear on your

budget

may help. And keeping track of the money you have coming and going is always a good idea, no matter your financial goals.

Choose a system that works for you:

There’s no one-size-fits-all

budgeting system

, and budgeting can be harder for some people than others. For example,

being neurodiverse

can come with unique financial challenges. But the good news is that there are several ways to budget, and you can find the way that works for you, like the zero-based approach, the envelope system or the 50/30/20 budget.

Use technology to make things easier:

Technology can make budgeting easier by letting you keep track of all of your financial accounts, categorize your expenses and automate your payments. There are also several

budget apps

to help you stay on top of your money.

Lower your bills

Finding ways to reduce your monthly bills can help to free up more money to put toward debt payoff. And every little bit counts. Don’t be afraid to contact your service providers and see if you can negotiate a better rate on expenses like your

cell phone bill

or

energy bill

.

You may also be able to

negotiate your bills

for things like your car insurance, credit cards, gym memberships and cable service. Switching providers might get you a better deal. Do your research to compare the rates of different companies, be firm and don’t forget to make follow-up calls if needed.

Make more money

If you have the ability,

making more money

even in the short term can boost your debt repayment plan.

Consider getting a part-time job, selling gently used or unused items or using your skills to do freelance work. A side hustle like house sitting, driving for Uber or Lyft or even dog walking can fuel your progress.

Don’t rule out the possibility of increasing your current salary. Research and preparation may help you

Don’t be afraid of debt relief

If you’ve tried budgeting, negotiating your payments and bringing in more cash, all to no avail, you might want to try debt relief.

Debt relief

can help you change the amount or the terms of your debt to lighten your financial burden, but it’s not for everyone.

You should also explore debt relief if paying off your unsecured debt like credit card bills, personal loans and medical debt within five years isn’t feasible or if your total amount of unsecured debt equals 50% or more of your gross income.

Debt management

typically involves working with an accredited counseling agency to pay off your debt at reduced interest rates or with waived fees.

Bankruptcy

— Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are the two most common forms — involves either erasing most unsecured debt or being placed on a court-approved repayment plan for three to five years.

Debt settlement

might suit people who don’t qualify for bankruptcy or who simply don’t want to file for it. You can try settling debt on your own by contacting creditors or you can hire a company to do it for you.

What is Market Structure?

Market structure, in economics, refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for goods and services. It is based on the characteristics that influence the behavior and outcomes of companies working in a specific market.

Some of the factors that determine a market structure include the number of buyers and sellers, ability to negotiate, degree of concentration, degree of

differentiation of products

, and the ease or difficulty of entering and exiting the market.

Summary

Market structure refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods.

The four popular types of market structures include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.

Market structures show the relations between sellers and other sellers, sellers to buyers, or more.

Understanding Market Structures

In economics, market structures can be understood well by closely examining an array of factors or features exhibited by different players. It is common to differentiate these markets across the following seven distinct features.

The industry’s buyer structure

The turnover of customers

The extent of product differentiation

The nature of costs of inputs

The number of players in the market

Vertical integration

extent in the same industry

The largest player’s market share

By cross-examining the above features against each other, similar traits can be established. Therefore, it becomes easier to categorize and differentiate companies across related industries. Based on the above features, economists have used this information to describe four distinct types of market structures. They include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.

Types of Market Structures

1.

Perfect Competition

Perfect competition occurs when there is a large number of small companies competing against each other. They sell similar products (homogeneous), lack price influence over the commodities, and are free to enter or exit the market.

Consumers in this type of market have full knowledge of the goods being sold. They are aware of the prices charged on them and the

product branding

. In the real world, the pure form of this type of market structure rarely exists. However, it is useful when comparing companies with similar features. This market is unrealistic as it faces some significant criticisms described below.

No incentive for innovation:

In the real world, if competition exists and a company holds a dominant market share, there is a tendency to increase innovation to beat the competitors and maintain the status quo. However, in a perfectly competitive market, the profit margin is fixed, and sellers cannot increase prices, or they will lose their customers.

There are very few barriers to entry:

Any company can enter the market and start selling the product. Therefore, incumbents must stay proactive to maintain market share.

2.

Monopolistic Competition

Monopolistic competition

refers to an imperfectly competitive market with the traits of both the monopoly and competitive market. Sellers compete among themselves and can differentiate their goods in terms of quality and branding to look different. In this type of competition, sellers consider the price charged by their competitors and ignore the impact of their own prices on their competition.

When comparing monopolistic competition in the short term and long term, there are two distinct aspects that are observed. In the short term, the monopolistic company maximizes its profits and enjoys all the benefits as a monopoly.

The company initially produces many products as the demand is high. Therefore, its Marginal Revenue (MR) corresponds to its Marginal Cost (MC). However, MR diminishes over time as new companies enter the market with differentiated products affecting demand, leading to less profit.

3.

Oligopoly

An oligopoly market consists of a small number of large companies that sell differentiated or identical products. Since there are few players in the market, their competitive strategies are dependent on each other.

For example, if one of the actors decides to reduce the price of its products, the action will trigger other actors to lower their prices, too. On the other hand, a price increase may influence others not to take any action in the anticipation consumers will opt for their products. Therefore, strategic planning by these types of players is a must.

In a situation where companies mutually compete, they may create agreements to share the market by restricting production, leading to supernormal profits. This holds if either party honors the Nash equilibrium state and neither is tempted to engage in the prisoner’s dilemma. In such an agreement, they work like monopolies. The

collusion

is referred to as cartels.

4.

Monopoly

In a monopoly market, a single company represents the whole industry. It has no competitor, and it is the sole seller of products in the entire market. This type of market is characterized by factors such as the sole claim to ownership of resources, patent and copyright, licenses issued by the government, or high initial setup costs.

All the above characteristics associated with monopoly restrict other companies from entering the market. The company, therefore, remains a single seller because it has the power to control the market and set prices for its goods.

My Finance 101 Notes

July 25, 2023. Today, I am re-summarizing some of the key points I’ve learned from CFI: Corporate Finance Fundamental course I took.

Let’s begin! ;)

Optimal Capital Structure

— company’s different sources of financing, such as debt, equity, and other financial instruments that allows the company to minimize its overall cost of capital and maximize shareholder value.

The optimal capital structure of a firm is often defined as the proportion of debt and equity that results to the lowest weighted average cost of debt and equity (WACC) of the firm.

As an indicator, if the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is lower than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) then it is advisable to either repurchase shares or pay cash dividends as it indicates that the company’s projects or investments are not generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. In other words, the company is not earning enough from its investments to cover the costs of financing those investments.

However, if the IRR was greater than the WACC of the business then it indicate that they may reinvest the project for better returns as it means that the project or investment is generating returns that exceed the cost of financing. In this situation, the company has an opportunity to earn more from the investment than it is paying in interest or financing costs.

WACC Formula

Cost of Equity

— the rate of return a shareholder requires for investing equity into business

Cost of Debt

— the rate of return a lender requires given the risk of the business

Terminologies;

Debt Capital

— raised by borrowing money from various sources, such as banks, bondholders, or other financial institutions. It includes different forms of debt securities. As companies pay interest on the borrowed funds, they are obligated to repay the principal amount within a specified period.

Equity Capital

— funds raised by issuing shares of ownership in the company to investors. Equity shareholders have ownership stakes in the company and may be entitled to voting rights and a share in the company’s profits through dividends.

Knowing that the optimal capital structure relies on equity versus debt decision, it is important to take note that HAVING TOO MUCH DEBT may increase the risk of default in repayment while DEPENDING TOO HEAVENLY ON EQUITY may dilute earnings and value for investors.

Other key factors to consider when determining the optimal capital structure:

Cost of Capital

Note: Debt is usually cheaper than equity due to tax advantages (interest payments are tax-deductible), but too much debt can increase financial risk and interest expenses.

2.

Risk Tolerance

Note: Higher debt levels can magnify financial risk, as debt obligations must be met regardless of the company’s performance.

3.

Industry and Business Characteristics

Note: The industry in which a company operates and its business model influence the optimal capital structure. Some industries may be more debt-heavy, while others may rely more on equity financing.

4.

Flexibility and Growth

Note: If you are expecting rapid growth or significant investment opportunities, prefer a capital structure that provides flexibility in raising additional funds.

5.

Market Conditions

Note: Market conditions, interest rates, and investor preferences also influence the availability and cost of debt and equity financing. This includes industry trends and company’s credit score.

6.

Debt Covenants and Restrictions

Note: Debt covenants and restrictions that come with borrowing can impact the company’s operational and financial flexibility as it may result to operational constraints, capital expenditure limitations, dividend and distribution restrictions, change of control provisions, additional collateral requirements, and costs of borrowing.

Pricing Strategy Under Each Market Structure

25 Sep 2021

Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate.

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand, the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices.

Suppliers can only supply what the consumers can consume at given prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers and therefore operate for as long as production costs fall below revenue.

Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can successfully set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. Since there are many producers, this will not affect the market as a whole. zolpidem gocce online

megacanabisdispensary.com

ambien online europe

A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products.

Also, since there are many competitors, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices.

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy

Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars.

Generally, an optimal pricing strategy, in the long run, incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors.

There are varied assumptions and strategies under oligopolistic competition as follows;

The game theory:

As oligopoly firms’ decisions are interdependent, pricing and output strategy preferences may be determined by how competitors react to their prices and output decisions. Consequently, the price will fluctuate between monopoly prices if firms collude successfully, and perfect competition prices equal marginal costs.

Collusion among competitors:

Assuming all producers agree to share the market to maximize industry profits, they will produce a quantity for which marginal costs equal marginal revenues and charge a price based on the demand curve for the quantity produced.

The kinked demand curve:

Firms produce the quantity of goods for which marginal revenue equals marginal cost so that competitors will match a price decrease and not an increase in prices. Since demand curves become kinked and the marginal revenue becomes discontinuous, the optimal quantity is the same for many cost structures.

The dominant firm model;

This scenario requires that the dominant firm produce the quantity for which its marginal costs equal its marginal revenues and charge the price indicated by its firm demand curve. Other companies in the marketplace will almost certainly accept that price as given, and they will produce quantities that have a marginal cost equal to the price.

Monopoly Market Structure

The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits, if you may, in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.

Question

In monopolistic competitive markets, firms:

are price takers.

set their own prices.

react to the prices set by competitors.

Solution

The correct answer is

B

.

In monopolistic competition, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.

Excelente para el FRM 2

Escribo esta revisión en español para los hispanohablantes, soy de Bolivia, y utilicé 

 AnalystPrep para dudas y consultas sobre mi preparación para el FRM nivel 2 (lo tomé una sola vez y aprobé muy bien), siempre tuve un soporte claro, directo y rápido, el material sale rápido cuando hay cambios en el temario de GARP, y los ejercicios y exámenes son muy útiles para practicar.

So helpful. I have been using the videos to prepare for the CFA Level II exam. The videos signpost the reading contents, explain the concepts and provide additional context for specific concepts. 

The fun light-hearted analogies are also a welcome break to some very dry content.



I usually watch the videos before going into more in-depth reading and they are a good way to avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content when you look at the readings.

A great curriculum provider. James sir explains the concept so well that rather than memorising it, you tend to intuitively understand and absorb them. 

Thank you ! Grateful I saw this at the right time for my CFA prep.

Professor James' videos are excellent for understanding the underlying theories behind financial engineering / financial analysis. The AnalystPrep videos were better than any of the others that I searched through on YouTube for providing a clear explanation of some concepts, such as Portfolio theory, CAPM, and Arbitrage Pricing theory. Watching these cleared up many of the unclarities I had in my head. Highly recommended.

Describe Pricing Strategy Under Each Market Structure

10 Oct 2019

Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate.

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand, the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices.

Suppliers can only supply what the consumers can consume at given prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers and therefore operate for as long as production costs fall below revenue.

Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy

In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can successfully set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. Since there are many producers, this will not affect the market as a whole.

A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products.

Also, since there are many competitors, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices.

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy

Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars.

Generally, an optimal pricing strategy, in the long run, incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors.

Monopoly Market Structure

The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits, if you may, in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.

Question

In monopolistic competitive markets, firms:

A.  are price takers;

B.  react to the prices set by competitors; or

C.  set their own prices.

Solution

The correct answer is C.

In monopolistic competition, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.

So helpful. I have been using the videos to prepare for the CFA Level II exam. The videos signpost the reading contents, explain the concepts and provide additional context for specific concepts. 

The fun light-hearted analogies are also a welcome break to some very dry content.



I usually watch the videos before going into more in-depth reading and they are a good way to avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content when you look at the readings.

Knowing how to work with the numbers in a company's

financial statements

is an essential skill for stock investors. The meaningful interpretation and analysis of

balance sheets

, income statements, and

cash flow statements

to discern a company's investment qualities is the basis for smart investment choices.

However, the diversity of

financial reporting

requires that we first become familiar with certain

financial statement

characteristics before focusing on individual corporate financials. In this article, we'll show you what the financial statements have to offer and how to use them to your advantage.

Key Takeaways

Understanding how to read a company's financial statements is a key skill for any investor wanting to make smart investment choices.

There are four sections to a company's financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, the cash flow statement, and the explanatory notes.

Prudent investors might also want to review a company's 10-K, which is the detailed financial report the company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

An investor should also review non-financial information that could impact a company's return, such as the state of the economy, the quality of the company's management, and the company's competitors.

1. Financial Statement = Scorecard

There are millions of individual investors worldwide, and while a large percentage of these investors have chosen

mutual funds

as the vehicle of choice for their investing activities, many others are also investing directly in stocks. Prudent investing practices dictate that we seek out quality companies with strong balance sheets, solid

earnings

, and positive

cash flows

.

Whether you're a do-it-yourself investor or rely on guidance from an investment professional, learning certain fundamental

financial statement analysis

skills can be very useful. Almost 30 years ago, businessman Robert Follett wrote a book entitled

How To Keep Score In Business

. His principal point was that in business you keep score with dollars, and the scorecard is a financial statement. He recognized that ""a lot of people don't understand keeping score in business. They get mixed up about profits,

assets

, cash flow, and

return on investment

.""

The same thing could be said today about a large portion of the investing public, especially when it comes to identifying investment values in financial statements. But don't let this intimidate you; it can be done.

2. Financial Statements to Use

The financial statements used in investment analysis are the balance sheet, the

income statement

, and the cash flow statement with additional analysis of a company's

shareholders' equity

and

retained earnings

. Although the income statement and the balance sheet typically receive the majority of the attention from investors and analysts, it's important to include in your analysis the often overlooked cash flow statement.

3. What's Behind the Numbers?

The numbers in a company's financial statements reflect the company's business, products, services, and macro-fundamental events. These numbers and the financial ratios or indicators derived from them are easier to understand if you can visualize the underlying realities of the fundamentals driving the

quantitative

information. For example, before you start crunching numbers, it's critical to develop an understanding of what the company does, its products and/or services, and the industry in which it operates.

4. Diversity of Reporting

Don't expect financial statements to fit into a single mold. Many articles and books on financial statement analysis take a one-size-fits-all approach. Less-experienced investors might get lost when they encounter a presentation of accounts that falls outside the mainstream of a so-called ""typical"" company. Please remember that the diverse nature of

business activities

results in a diverse set of financial statement presentations. This is particularly true of the balance sheet; the income statement and cash flow statement are less susceptible to this phenomenon.

5. Understanding Financial Jargon

The lack of any appreciable standardization of financial reporting terminology complicates the understanding of many financial statement account entries. This circumstance can be confusing for the beginning investor. There's little hope that things will change on this issue in the foreseeable future, but a good financial dictionary can help considerably.

Investopedia's

Glossary of Terms

provides you with thousands of definitions and detailed explanations to help you understand terms related to finance, investing, and economics.

6. Accounting: Art, Not Science

The presentation of a company's financial position, as portrayed in its financial statements, is influenced by management's estimates and judgments. In the best of circumstances, management is scrupulously honest and candid, while the outside auditors are demanding, strict, and uncompromising. Whatever the case, the imprecision that can be inherently found in the accounting process means that the prudent investor should take an inquiring and skeptical approach toward financial statement analysis.

7. Key Accounting Conventions

Generally accepted accounting principles

(GAAP) or

International Financial Reporting Standards

(IFRS) are used to prepare financial statements. Both methods are legal in the United States, although GAAP is most commonly used. The main difference between the two methods is that GAAP is more ""rules-based,"" while IFRS is more ""principles-based."" Both have different ways of reporting asset values, depreciation, and inventory, to name a few.

8. Non-Financial Information

Information on the state of the economy, the industry, competitive considerations, market forces, technological change, the quality of management and the workforce are not directly reflected in a company's financial statements. Investors need to recognize that financial statement insights are but one piece, albeit an important one, of the larger investment puzzle.

9. Financial Ratios and Indicators

The absolute numbers in financial statements are of little value for investment analysis unless these numbers are transformed into meaningful relationships to judge a company's

financial performance

and gauge its financial health. The resulting ratios and

indicators

must be viewed over extended periods to spot trends. Please beware that evaluative financial

metrics

can differ significantly by industry, company size, and stage of development.

10. Notes to Financial Statements

The financial statement numbers don't provide all of the

disclosure

required by regulatory authorities. Analysts and investors alike universally agree that a thorough understanding of the

notes to financial statements

is essential to properly evaluate a company's financial condition and performance. As noted by auditors on financial statements ""the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements."" Please include a thorough review of the noted comments in your investment analysis.

11. The Annual Report/10-K

Prudent investors should only consider investing in companies with audited financial statements, which are a requirement for all publicly-traded companies. Perhaps even before digging into a company's financials, an investor should look at the company's

annual report

and the

10-K

. Much of the annual report is based on the 10-K, but contains less information and is presented in a marketable document intended for an audience of shareholders. The 10-K is reported directly to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC and tends to contain more details than other reports.

Included in the annual report is the

auditor's report

, which gives an auditor's opinion on how the accounting principles have been applied. A ""clean opinion"" provides you with a green light to proceed. Qualifying remarks may be benign or serious; in the case of the latter, you may not want to proceed.

12. Consolidated Statements

Typically, the word ""consolidated"" appears in the title of a financial statement, as in a

consolidated balance sheet

. A consolidation of a

parent company

and its majority-owned (more than 50% ownership or ""effective control"")

subsidiaries

means that the combined activities of separate legal entities are expressed as one economic unit. The presumption is that consolidation as one entity is more meaningful than separate statements for different entities.

Why are Financial Statements Important?

Financial statements provide investors with information about a company's financial position, helping to ensure corporate transparency and accountability. Understanding how to interpret key financial reports, such as a balance sheet and cash flow statement, helps investors assess a company’s financial health before making an investment. Investors can also use information disclosed in the financial statements to calculate

ratios

for making comparisons against previous periods and competitors.

What Key Financial Statements Should I Understand When Analyzing a Company?

Investors should start by learning how to interpret key figures on a company's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. Those wanting to dig a little deeper may want to consider learning how to analyze reports, such as shareholder’s equity and retained earnings. Investors can find a publicly traded company’s financial statements in its annual report or a 10-K filed with the SEC.

What’s the Difference Between GAAP and IFRS Accounting Conventions?

GAAP sets accounting guidelines and standards that companies must follow when preparing financial statements, whereas

IFRS

takes a more principles-based approach. Both conventions differ in how they report asset values, depreciation, and inventory. GAAP typically requires more disclosures than IFRS, with the latter providing much less overall detail. Both accounting methods are legal in the United States.

What are Some Key Limitations of Using Financial Statements?

Financial statements only provide a snapshot of a company's financial situation at a specific point in time. They also don't consider non-financial information, such as the health of the broader economy, and other factors, such as income inequality or

environmental sustainability

. Forward-looking financial statements rely on estimates and assumptions, which may not always be accurate and are subject to change.

The Bottom Line

Understanding the basics of financial statements provides investors with valuable information about a company's financial health. Investors can use key reports, such as a balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement, to evaluate a company's performance, helping to make more informed investment decisions. However, it’s also important to understand the limitations of overly relying on financial statements and consider other metrics, such as the impact of non-financial information, when analyzing a company's overall financial position. Financial statements play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the

financial system

and promoting trust between companies and investors.

John Rotonti:

Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin.

Chris Hill:

I'm Chris Hill, and that was Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti. What are you buying when you buy a stock? No, really, what are you buying? Today John kicks off a two-part series on the basics of financial statements, including what goes into a balance sheet, how the sale of a burrito at

Chipotle

(

CMG

-0.50%

)

become shareholder equity, and how financial statements work together.

John Rotonti:

Fools, John Rotonti here. Today we are going to be talking about the three primary financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. Let's just start with the balance sheet really quickly. The balance sheet, Fools, is called the balance sheet because it must balance at all times, and the simple formula is assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity, and that must always balance. A must always equal L plus SE, assets equals liabilities plus shareholders equity. Let's just look at a quick example using Chipotle, ticker CMG. Chipotle has total assets, so assets of 6,653 million. Then it has total liabilities of 4,355.6 million and total shareholders' equity of 2,297.4 million. If you remember, A, assets, equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity. So if we take the liabilities of Chipotle of 4,355.6, and we add the shareholders' equity of 2,297.4, you will get the total assets of 6,653 to the penny. To the penny, Fools, the balance sheet must balance at all times. Assets must be equal liabilities plus shareholders' equity. Then, of course, we can reconfigure that basic formula to get shareholders' equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities. All we've done is move some variables from one side of the equation to the other. Shareholders' equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities. Assets minus liabilities is how you get shareholders' equity. If we do that again, if we take total assets of 6,653, and we subtract total liabilities of 4,355.6, you will get total shareholders' equity of 2,297.4. Now that is why it is called the balance sheet. The left-hand of that equation, A equals L plus SE, assets, is what the company owns; liabilities, what the company owes. Now, when you're looking at a balance sheet, it starts at the top of the balance sheet with the most liquid assets, and it moves down the balance sheet. As you move down the balance sheet, those assets become less liquid. The definition of liquidity is the speed and ease at which you could turn the asset into cold, hard cash. The very top line of the balance sheet is cash and cash equivalents. That's already cash. That's the most liquid, Fools. You don't need to convert it to cash. That's why it's at the top.

Then we move down the balance sheet, and we get things like account. I'm not going to go line for line because if I was teaching this class at an MBA level, I'll probably spend three or four full classes, just on the balance sheet. So I can't go line by line. But then you have things like accounts receivable, which is money owed to Chipotle that has not yet been paid. That's an asset. It is owed to Chipotle. Those receivables, when people buy on credit and stuff, they're going to receive those pretty quickly. So that's pretty liquid. It's going to be turned into cash pretty quickly. Inventories, the raw materials, the food that they plan to sell, you can turn that into cash pretty quickly too because we're talking about a restaurant here. Those raw fresh ingredients that Chipotle is known for, they're going to spoil. They're going to expire. They have to use those ingredients and sell them within a day or two or something like that. They can convert inventories, which is another asset to cash pretty quickly, so it's liquid. But then you move down that balance sheet, and you get things like property, plant, and equipment, literally, buildings, facilities, all of the expensive kitchen equipment they have, property, plant, equipment. They can't turn that into cash immediately. If they wanted to sell that stuff, they'd have to get a broker, find a buyer, write up some contracts, some agreement, it takes time. So it's less liquid. There's other long-term investments as well, such as goodwill.

Every company start with zero goodwill, believe it or not, zero goodwill. A company only gets goodwill on its balance sheet when it acquires another company and pays above book value. That's how you acquire goodwill. It's something that ends up on your balance sheet when you buy another company, and it's an asset. Then you have liabilities. You have payables. That's money that you owe, but you have not paid yet. You have short-term debt. You have short-term leases, then you have long-term leases. You have long-term debt. There are other liabilities as well, but once again, you move from the most liquid down through the balance sheet to the least liquid. Now shareholders' equity has two other names. They all mean the same thing. They're synonyms. Shareholders' equity is also book value. How do you calculate book value? Total assets minus total liabilities. Book value is literally the value of your assets, what you own minus your total liabilities, what you owe. The other synonym for total equity is net worth. This is the company's net worth. Just like you can calculate your personal net worth based on your total assets, what you own, minus your total liabilities, what you owe. So total shareholders equity is equal to book value is equal to net worth. One last thing before I move on to the next financial statement. Think of assets, as we've said, that's what you own, that's the left-hand side of that equation. The other side of the equation, liabilities and shareholders' equity is the sources of funds to buy those assets. Think about it this way. This is going to be exciting. Assets are the uses of the funds. That's the uses of the funds. The company takes the right-hand side of the equation, the liabilities, i.e, debt, and shareholders' equity, i.e, what owners contribute. Those are the two primary sources of funds, and the company takes those to buy or build assets, the left-hand side of the equation, the uses of those funds. That's the balance sheet, Fools, called the balance sheet because it must balance at all times.

We're going to switch over to the income statement really quickly, sticking with Chipotle here. Some people call this the profit and loss statement, the P&L. We went over this in a prior segment, but it's important to review again because we're going to need it for when we get to the cash flow statement. So bear with me really quickly. The sale or revenue, think of those words as synonyms. I think a lot of companies that actually sell a tangible product use the word sales, and companies like software that don't sell tangible product that you can touch and feel use the word revenue. Think of sales for products, and revenue for software and services. But honestly, I've seen product companies use the word revenue, and I've seen software and services company use word sales. It doesn't matter. Honestly, sales and revenue are the exact same thing, and they are the top line of the income statement. They are the top line because they are at the top of the piece of paper. The sale is what happens at the point of sale.

In Chipotle's case, it is when the customer goes into the store, and orders, and pays for it at the point of sale system. These things used to be called cash registers. Now they're like little square iPads or whatever, but it's a point of sale computer system, called a POS, or when someone orders online and press ""Buy"" online, that's the point of sale. That is the sale. So you go into Chipotle, you buy a $7 chicken burrito or whatever and a drink. I think the average chicken at Chipotle is probably somewhere around $12 with tax, all in, I think. But let's just use a $7 burrito, that's the sale. From that, we subtract the cost of goods sold. That is all of the input costs as well as the employee wages that go into making that burrito. This does not include the salary of the CEO, and the COO, and everything else back at headquarters. This includes the people working in the Chipotle kitchen, on the frontline, on the backline, contributing in making that burrito. Those are wages that are included in cost of goods sold. It also includes all of the food, all the raw materials, all the ingredients. You got to have the chicken, or whether it's beef, or pork, whatever you're putting in your burrito. Avocados, those things are expensive. Those things are going through the moon. Avocados, tomatoes, onions, other basil, and spices that go into their spices and their sauces. Lettuce, I said onions, peppers. The chips, can't go to Chipotle without getting those chips, right? The tortillas, the wraps, anything that they need to make that Chipotle goes in that cost of goods sold. You take revenue, the $7 burrito, you subtract your cost of goods sold, and you get a number called gross profit. This is what we talk about when we're talking about unit economics.

If a company can price its products higher than its input costs, it will generate a gross product at the burrito level. That's the unit level. So that's its gross profit. Now, if you want to calculate the gross, we just said gross profit, sales minus cost of goods sold, you get gross profit. If you want to calculate the gross profit margin, you simply take that absolute gross profit dollar amount, the gross profits, and divide it by sales. When you are calculating a margin, you simply take the profit dollar amount that you're looking at and scale it by sales, divide it by sales. So gross profit margin is gross profit divided by sales. Now when you're talking about gross profit, you are talking about unit economics, you're also talking about pricing power. What if sales grow a little faster than cost of goods sold grow? You know the answer. That means your gross profit margin is going to increase over time, a sign of pricing power. Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power, and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin. So we have gross profit. From that, we subtract operating expenses. You got to keep the lights on. You got to pay your utilities. You got to pay your water bill. You have to pay all of the other salaries and expenses back at headquarters, if there's research and development, the research and development cost to come up with new recipes, sales and marketing. So R&D, research and development, sales and marketing, all of these things are operating expenses. These are cost of doing business. That's operating expenses. So gross profit, you subtract these operating expenses, you got to keep your lights on, you get operating income.

Now if you haven't been paying attention, you should start now. Operating income is also called earnings before interest and taxes, E-B-I-T or EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes. That's operating income. From operating income or EBIT, E-B-I-T, we subtract the interest expense on the debt, if the company has any debt, of which Chipotle does. Notice debt holders get paid first. They have a primary claim on a company's cash flows. There is a packing order, Fools, to who gets paid. Debt holders, or creditors, they get paid first. We just paid the I, the interest expense. Remember, we had E-B-I-T. We just pay the interest, so now we are left with E-B-T, earnings before taxes. So who gets paid next? The government in the form of taxes. So debt holders get paid first, and then the government in the form of taxes. Now what is left over after the company has paid its cost of goods sold, after the company has paid all of those other operating expenses, utility bills, research and development, sales and marketing, after the company has paid its interest on its debt, if it has any, after the company has paid its taxes to the government, if there is money left over, that is called net income, or net profit, or net earnings.

The three words mean the same thing, and that, Fools, is what you are buying as a shareholder. We get the residual claim of what is left over after all of those expenses we just went through are paid. We get residual claim. We get the bottom line. Why is it called the bottom line? Because it is at the bottom of the income statement. We get what is leftover. We have a residual claim on a company's cash flows. When you buy a stock, legally, what are you buying? When you buy a stock, you are buying a claim on the company's future net income, or future net profits, or future net earnings. You are buying a very small percentage of the company's future net income. That, Fools, is the income statement. Now why do I want to go through that? Because when you buy a stock, that's what you're legally buying, but also because we need to go to the cash flow statement, the third financial statement. Now remember how I just said net income is the bottom line of the cash flow statement? Guess what, net income, the same exact number that's on that income statement, then becomes the top line of the cash flow statement. [MUSIC] This is critical to understand. This is critical. The bottom line of the income statement, net income, becomes the top line of the cash flow statement.

Chris Hill:

That was part 1. Next Saturday, on part 2, John will dig into the cash flow statement and all the places your money can go before it gets to shareholders. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you tomorrow.

Financial Analysis

What is Net Present Value?

Net present value is an analysis tool used to decide whether to invest in a

capital asset

. It is employed as part of the

capital budgeting

process. A desirable investment is one that yields a positive net present value, which implies that a business will receive excess

cash

over time as a result of the

investment

. A negative net present value indicates that a company will lose money on a proposed investment. A negative net present value is usually grounds to terminate an investment that is under consideration.

How to Calculate Net Present Value

Net present value is calculated as the difference between the present value of one or more inbound

cash flows

and one or more outbound cash flows. The

discounted cash flow

methodology is used to derive

present value

, using a

discount rate

as the basis for the discounting. The discount rate is typically based on the

cost of capital

of the business running the analysis. If the cash flows associated with a proposed investment are expected to be unusually risky, then the discount rate may be increased, thereby reducing the net present value of the associated cash flows.

Advantages of Net Present Value

A key benefit of net present value is that it reduces the cash flows associated with a project to one numeric value, which can be easily compared to the net present values of other projects. The project generating the highest net present value is then selected for investment, while the other projects are assigned a lower priority or rejected.

Disadvantages of Net Present Value

Net present value is not a perfect analysis tool, for it suffers from several problems. First, estimated cash flows rarely match actual results, especially when the original estimates are excessively optimistic. Second, the discount rate used for a

capital asset

analysis may not be appropriate, given the incremental cost of the capital required to fund a project. Third, an adjustment of the discount rate to account for risk is usually a guess; there is no quantitative derivation of the adjustment. And finally, an investment based on a net present value analysis only looks at the circumstances of a specific investment, rather than the entire system of profit generation; thus, investments using NPV can be sub-optimized.

5 Methods for Capital Budgeting

5 Methods for Capital Budgeting

Capital budgeting is defined as the process used to determine whether capital assets are worth investing in. Capital assets are generally only a small portion of a company’s total assets, but they are usually long-term investments like new equipment, facilities and software upgrades. By incorporating strategically planned capital budgeting into their financial processes, companies can more effectively determine and prioritize which projects, programs and other investment assets could be most financially beneficial in the long-term. As these assets often only generate tangible returns in the long-term, it is important that practicing finance professionals develop an understanding of the five primary methods of capital budgeting, and how they can be utilized to decide the best course of action when firms are planning their next significant capital investment.

Internal Rate of Return

The internal rate of return calculation is used to determine whether a particular investment is worthwhile by assessing the interest that should be yielded over the course of a capital investment. It is determined by using a particular formula that must be calculated through trial-and-error or by using specific software. As the internal rate of return helps aid investors in measuring the profitability of their potential investments, the ideal internal rate of return for a project should be greater than the cost of capital required for the project, as it can be assumed that the project will be a profitable one.

Professionals who hope to maximize the potential of their capital investments need to leverage the internal rate of return when necessary, especially in instances where they are planning on analyzing an investment in venture capital, private equity or other operations that require a consistent cash investment that ends with a large payout, like a sale. When using this calculation, finance professionals should recognize that the measurement for the internal rate of return is similar to the net present value metric (another capital budgeting method); however, the internal rate of return is formulated to make the net present value of all cash flows in a project equal to zero. It is for this reason that companies shouldn’t rely solely on the internal rate of return calculation to project profitability of a project and should use it in conjunction with at least one other budgeting metric, like net present value.

Net Present Value

Net present value (NPV) is used for the same purpose as the internal rate of return, analyzing the projected returns for a potential investment or project. The net present value represents the difference between the current value of money flowing into the project and the current value of money being spent. The value can be calculated as positive or negative, with a positive net present value implying that the earnings generated by a project or investment will exceed the expected costs of the venture and should be pursued. Also, unlike other capital budgeting methods, like the profitability index and payback period metrics, NPV accounts for the time value of money, so opportunity costs and inflation are not ignored in the calculation. To achieve this, the net present value formula identifies a discount rate based on the costs of financing an investment or calculates the rates of return expected for similar investment options.

Unlike some capital budgeting methods, NPV also factors in the risk of making long-term investments. Therefore, the formula for net present value is longstanding and effective, but professionals in the industry must still recognize the potential room for error that arises when relying on calculations like investment costs, rates of discount, and projected returns, all of which rely heavily on assumptions and estimates. As accounting for unexpected expenses can be difficult when budgeting for capital investments, it is important to consider using payback period metrics and the internal rate of return as possible alternatives to net present value calculations when evaluating a project or investment.

Profitability Index

The profitability index is a capital budgeting tool designed to identify the relationship between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was successful. The profitability index employs a ratio that consists of the present value of future cash flows over the initial investment. As this ratio increases beyond 1.0, the proposed investment becomes more desirable to companies. When this ratio does not exceed 1.0, the investment should be deferred, as the project’s present value is less than the initial investment.

The caveat to using the profitability index for capital budgeting is that the technique does not account for the size of a project; therefore, sizable projects with significantly large cash flow figures often claim lower profitability indexes because of their slimmer profit margins. The upside of using the profitability index is that the index does account for the time value of investments in the calculation. It also identifies the exact rate of return for a project or investment, which makes understanding the cost-benefit ratio of projects easier.

Accounting Rate of Return

The accounting rate of return is the projected return that an organization can expect from a proposed capital investment. To discover the accounting rate of return, finance professionals must divide the average profit by the initial investment. The accounting rate of return is a useful metric for quickly calculating the profitability of a company, and it is widely used for analyzing the success rates of investments that feature multiple projects.

However, the accounting rate of return metric also has some minor drawbacks when used as the sole method for capital budgeting. The first drawback is that it does not account for the time value of the money involved—meaning that future returns may be worth significantly less than the returns currently being taken in. A second issue with relying solely on the accounting rate of return in capital budgeting is the lack of acknowledgement of cash flows. In contrast to these drawbacks, the accounting rate of return is quite useful for providing a clear picture of a project’s potential profitability, satisfying a firm’s desire to have a clear idea of the expected return on investment. This method also acknowledges earnings after tax and depreciation, making it effective for benchmarking a firm’s current level of performance.

Payback Period

The payback period is a unique capital budgeting method. Specifically, the payback period is a financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been invested. A subcategory, price-to-earnings growth payback period, is used to define the time required for a company’s earnings to find equivalence with the stock price paid by investors. The price-to-earnings growth payback period is also widely used to get a basic understanding of how risky an investment opportunity may be. Understanding the payback period of an investment limits the risks associated with taking on costly projects.

Payback periods are an integral component of capital budgeting and should always be incorporated when analyzing the value of projected investments and projects. The payback period can prove especially useful for companies that focus on smaller investments, mainly because smaller investments usually don’t involve overly complex calculations. Payments made at a later date still have an opportunity cost attached to the time that is spent, but the payback period disregards this in favor of simplicity. As with each method mentioned so far, the payback period does have its limitations, such as not accounting for the time value of money, risk factors, financing concerns or the opportunity cost of an investment. Therefore, using the payback period in combination with other capital budgeting methods is far more reliable.

When employing capital budgeting strategies at their respective businesses, finance professionals have a wide array of tools, formulas, and methods available to them. Yet, even with so many tools and options at hand, it’s important that firms remain mindful of their cash flows and capital assets to ensure that their investments prove profitable in the long-term. This way, companies can reap full benefits of capital budgeting by identifying and prioritizing the large investments, which are most likely to have a long-term impact on the company or organization.

What is Financial Modeling?

Financial modeling

is one of the most highly valued, but thinly understood, skills in financial analysis. The objective of financial modeling is to combine accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.

A financial model is simply a spreadsheet which is usually built in Microsoft Excel, that forecasts a business’s financial performance into the future. The forecast is typically based on the company’s historical performance and assumptions about the future, and requires preparing an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and supporting schedules (known as a

three-statement model

).

From there, more advanced types of models can be built such as discounted cash flow analysis (

DCF model

), leveraged buyout (

LBO

), mergers and acquisitions (

M&A

), and sensitivity analysis. Below is an example of financial modeling in Excel:

Image: CFI’s

Financial Modeling Courses

.

Key Highlights

Financial modeling combines accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.

The main goal of financial modeling is to accurately project a company’s future financial performance.

Modeling can be useful for valuing companies, determining whether a company should raise capital or grow the business organically or through acquisitions.

What is a Financial Model Used For?

There are many

types of financial models

with a wide range of uses. The output of a financial model is used for decision-making and performing financial analysis, whether inside or outside of the company. Financial models are used to make decisions about:

Raising capital (debt and/or equity)

Making acquisitions (businesses and/or assets)

Growing the business organically (e.g., opening new stores, entering new markets, etc.)

Selling or divesting assets and business units

Budgeting and

forecasting

(planning for the years ahead)

Capital allocation (priority of which projects to invest in)

Valuing a business

Financial statement analysis/ratio analysis

Management accounting

What Software is Best for Financial Modeling?

Forecasting a company’s operations into the future can be very complex. Each business is unique and requires a very specific set of assumptions and calculations.

Excel is used

because it is the most flexible and customizable spreadsheet tool available. Other software programs may be too rigid and specialized, whereas Excel knowledge is generally more universal.

Who Builds Financial Models?

There are many different types of professionals who build financial models. The most common types of career tracks are investment banking, equity research, corporate development, FP&A, and accounting (due diligence, transaction advisory, valuations, etc).

How Can You Learn Financial Modeling?

The best way to learn financial modeling is to practice. It takes years of experience to become an expert at

building financial models

,

and you really have to learn by doing. Reading equity research reports can be helpful, as they give you something to compare your results to. One of the best ways to practice is to take a mature company’s historical financials, build a model into the future, calculate the net present value per share, and compare your projections to current share prices or the target prices in equity research reports.

Taking a professional

financial modeling training course

also offers a solid base understanding of the relevant concepts and skills. In the meantime, you may be interested in exploring CFI’s

free Financial Modeling Guidelines

or having a go at building your own financial models.

.

How Much Accounting Knowledge is Required for Financial Modeling?

In order to build a financial model, you need a solid understanding of

accounting fundamentals

. You have to know what all the various accounts mean, how to calculate them, and how they’re connected. We recommend having at least a few accounting courses under your belt.

Learn more about Financial Modeling

Financial modeling is the application of data analysis to predict business performance, manage assets, and track cash flow. Financial modeling is a vital tool, essential for a business to succeed, whether it is a startup or a Fortune 500 company. A financial modeling course on Udemy can familiarize you with the concepts and strategies vital to business success.

Frequently asked questions

What is financial modeling?

Research analysts, investment bankers, accountants, and entrepreneurs use financial modeling to better understand a company’s performance before making important business decisions. Financial models are generated using MS Excel and can help you accomplish a variety of important tasks such as forecasting business performance, budgeting, asset management, and understanding cash flow. Financial modeling requires a keen sense of numbers and data to prepare the best financial reports for yourself or your clients.

What are some examples of financial models and what are they used for?

There are several different types of financial models used by professionals to help them make the best business decisions. Financial models help professionals make important business decisions about raising capital, forecasting business changes and requirements, or what it will take to grow a business. Some examples of these useful financial models are the discounted cash flow (DCF), a valuation method used to determine the worth of investing in a business; leveraged buyout (LBO), which examines the impact of funding an acquisition with debt; and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a method that analyzes the result of acquiring or merging with another company. These are just three of the models both new and seasoned financial professionals should expect to use in their careers.

What does an investment banker do?

Investment bankers assist corporations and individual investors by making a variety of critical decisions to best ensure the success of their business and financial growth. Investment bankers work in four areas of the financial services industry: capital markets, advisory, trading and brokerage, and asset management. Investment bankers usually work for investment banks that serve business clients. These banks are not like traditional commercial banks that members of the public use to handle their checking and savings accounts. In fact, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 requires a complete separation between investment banking and commercial banking. Investment bankers provide guidance and expertise to corporate clients seeking to issue an IPO (initial public offering) to raise capital that they could use to expand a business, acquire, or merge with another company.

What are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows?

Balance sheets help business owners, investment bankers, and accountants understand the assets of a business. In particular, balance sheets outline what the business owns, or its assets. It also notes what the business owes, or its debt and liabilities. A company’s income statement is just as important as its balance sheet and tells you how much profit a company generated during a particular year. The statement of cash flows is a useful tool for stakeholders and can provide insight into how effectively the organization manages its operations. Businesses use a statement of cash flows to understand a company’s performance, more specifically, to assess a company’s ability to generate cash from operations, financing, and investing.

What Is Risk Management?

Risk management involves identifying,

analyzing

, and accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. Put simply, it is the process of monitoring and dealing with the financial risks associated with investing. Risk management essentially occurs when an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment, such as a

moral hazard

, and then takes the appropriate action (or inaction) to meet their objectives and

risk tolerance

.

Key Takeaways

Risk management is the process of identification, analysis, and acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decisions.

Risk is inseparable from return in the investment world.

Risk management strategies include avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction.

One of the tactics to ascertain risk is standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of dispersion around a central tendency.

Investopedia / Joules Garcia

How Risk Management Works

Risk is inseparable from return. Every investment involves some degree of risk. It can come close to zero for U.S. T-bills or very high for emerging-market equities or real estate in highly inflationary markets. Risk is quantified in absolute and in relative terms. A solid understanding of risk in its different forms can help investors to better understand the opportunities, trade-offs, and costs involved with different

investment approaches

.

Risk management involves identifying and analyzing where risk exists, and making decisions about how to deal with it. It occurs everywhere in the realm of finance. For instance:

An investor may choose

U.S. Treasury

bonds over corporate bonds

A fund manager may hedge their currency exposure with currency

derivatives

A bank performs a credit check on an individual before issuing a personal line of credit

A stockbroker uses financial instruments like

options

and

futures

A money manager uses strategies like portfolio diversification, asset allocation, and position sizing to mitigate or effectively manage risk

Diligent risk management can help reduce the chance of losses while ensuring that financial goals are met. Inadequate risk management, though, can result in severe consequences for companies, individuals, and the economy. The

subprime mortgage meltdown

that led to the Great Recession stemmed from bad risk management. Lenders gave mortgages to people with bad credit and investment firms bought, packaged, and resold these loans to investors as risky,

mortgage-backed securities (MBSs)

.

Risk Management Techniques

The following is a list of some of the most common risk management techniques.

Avoidance:

The most obvious way to manage your risk is by avoiding it completely. Some investors make their investment decisions by cutting out volatility and risk completely. This means choosing the safest assets with little to no risks.

Retention:

This strategy involves accepting any risks that come your way and acknowledging that they come with the territory.

Sharing:

This technique comes with two or more parties taking on an agreed-upon portion of the risk. For instance,

reinsurers

cover risks that insurance companies can't handle on their own.

Transferring:

Risks can be passed on from one party to another. For instance, health insurance involves passing on the risk of coverage from you to your insurer as long as you keep up with your

premiums

.

Loss Prevention and Reduction:

Rather than eliminate the potential for risk, this strategy means that you find ways to minimize your losses by preventing them from spreading to other areas. Diversification may be a way for investors to reduce their losses.

The word risk is often thought of negatively. But risk is an integral part of the investment world and is inseparable from performance.

Risk Management and Volatility

Investment risk is the deviation from an expected outcome. This deviation is expressed in absolute terms or relative to something else like a market

benchmark

. Investment professionals generally accept the idea that the deviation implies some degree of the intended outcome for your investments, whether positive or negative.

To achieve higher returns, one expects to accept the greater risk. It is also a generally accepted idea that increased risk means increased

volatility

. While investment professionals constantly seek and occasionally find ways to reduce volatility, there is no clear agreement on how to do it.

How much volatility an investor should accept depends entirely on their risk tolerance. For investment professionals, it is based on the tolerance of their investment objectives. One of the most commonly used absolute risk metrics is

standard deviation

, which is a statistical measure of

dispersion

around a central tendency.

Here's how it works. Take the average return of an investment and find its average standard deviation over the same time period. Normal distributions (the familiar bell-shaped curve) dictate that the expected return of the investment may be one standard deviation from the average 67% of the time and two standard deviations from the average deviation 95% of the time. This provides a numeric risk evaluation. If the risk is tolerable (financially and emotionally), they can invest.

Risk Management and Psychology

Behavioral finance

highlights the imbalance between people's views of gains and losses. In prospect theory, an area of behavioral finance introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1979, investors exhibit loss aversion

.

They noted that investors put roughly twice the weight on the pain associated with a loss than the good feeling associated with a profit.

Investors often want to know the losses that come with an investment as well as how much an asset deviates from its expected outcome.

Value at risk (VAR)

tries to quantify the degree of loss associated with an investment with a given level of confidence over a defined period. For example, an investor may lose $200 on a $1,000 investment with a 95% level of confidence over a two-year

time horizon

. Keep in mind that a measure like VAR doesn't guarantee that 5% of the time will be much worse.

It also doesn't account for any outlier events, which hit hedge fund

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)

in 1998. The Russian government's default on its outstanding sovereign debt obligations threatened to bankrupt the hedge fund, which had highly

leveraged

positions worth over $1 trillion. Its failure could have collapsed the global financial system. But the U.S. government created a $3.65-billion loan fund to cover the losses, which enabled LTCM to survive the volatility and liquidate in early 2000.

The confidence level is a probability statement based on the statistical characteristics of the investment and the shape of its distribution curve.

Types of Risk Management

Beta and Passive

One risk measure oriented to behavioral tendencies is a

drawdown

, which refers to any period during which an asset's return is negative relative to a previous high mark. In measuring drawdown, we attempt to address three things:

The magnitude of each negative period (how bad)

The duration of each (how long)

The frequency (how often)

For example, in addition to wanting to know whether a mutual fund beat the S&P 500, we also want to know its comparative risk. One measure for this is

beta

. Also called market risk, beta is based on the statistical property of

covariance

. A beta greater than 1 indicates more risk than the market while a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.

Beta helps us to understand the concepts of passive and

active risk

. The graph below shows a

time series

of returns (each data point labeled ""+"") for a particular portfolio R(p) versus the market return R(m). The returns are cash-adjusted, so the point at which the x and y-axes intersect is the cash-equivalent return. Drawing a

line of best fit

through the data points allows us to quantify the passive risk (beta) and the active risk (alpha).

Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020

The gradient of the line is its beta. So a gradient of 1 indicates that for every unit increase in market return, the portfolio return also increases by one unit. A money manager employing a passive management strategy can attempt to increase the

portfolio return

by taking on more market risk (i.e., a beta greater than 1) or alternatively decrease portfolio risk (and return) by reducing the portfolio beta below one.

Alpha and Active

If market or systematic risk were the only influencing factor, then a portfolio's return would always be equal to the beta-adjusted market return. But this isn't the case. Returns vary because of a number of factors unrelated to

market risk

. Investment managers who follow an active strategy take on other risks to achieve excess returns over the market's performance, including:

Tactics that

leverage

stock

Sector or country selection

Fundamental analysis

Position sizing

Technical analysis

Active managers hunt for an alpha, the measure of excess return. In our diagram example above, alpha is the amount of portfolio return not explained by beta, which is represented as the distance between the intersection of the x and y-axes and the y-axis intercept. This can be positive or negative.

In their quest for excess returns, active managers expose investors to

alpha risk

, the risk that the result of their bets will prove negative rather than positive. For example, a fund manager may think that the energy sector will outperform the S&P 500 and increase her portfolio's weighting in this sector. If unexpected economic developments cause energy stocks to sharply decline, the manager will likely underperform the benchmark.

The Cost of Risk

The more an active fund and its managers can generate alpha, the higher the fees they tend to charge. For purely passive vehicles like

index funds

or

exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

, you're likely to pay one to 10

basis points (bps)

in annual management fees. Investors may pay 200 bps in annual fees for a high-octane hedge fund with complex trading strategies, high capital commitments, and transaction costs. They may also have to give back 20% of the profits to the manager.

The pricing difference between passive (

beta risk

) and active strategies (alpha risk) encourages many investors to try and separate these risks, such as paying lower fees for the beta risk assumed and concentrating costly exposures to specifically defined alpha opportunities. This is popularly known as

portable alpha

, the idea that the alpha component of a total return is separate from the beta component.

For instance, a fund manager may claim to have an active

sector rotation

strategy for beating the S&P 500 with a track record of beating the index by 1.5% on an average annualized basis. This excess return is the manager's value (the alpha) and the investor is willing to pay higher fees to obtain it. The rest of the total return (what the S&P 500 itself earned) arguably has nothing to do with the manager's unique ability. Portable alpha strategies use derivatives and other tools to refine how they obtain and pay for the alpha and beta components of their

exposure

.

Example of Risk Management

During a 15-year period from Aug. 1, 1992, to July 31, 2007, the average

annualized total return

of the

S&P 500

was 10.7%. This number reveals what happened for the whole period, but it does not say what happened along the way.

The average standard deviation of the S&P 500 for that same period was 13.5%. This is the difference between the average return and the real return at most given points throughout the 15-year period.

When applying the bell curve model, any given outcome should fall within one standard deviation of the mean about 67% of the time and within two standard deviations about 95% of the time. Thus, an S&P 500 investor could expect the return, at any given point during this period, to be 10.7% plus or minus the standard deviation of 13.5% about 67% of the time. They may also assume a 27% (two standard deviations) increase or decrease 95% of the time. If they can afford the loss, they invest.

Why Is Risk Management Important?

Risk management is a key part of the investment and financial world. It requires investors and fund managers to identify, analyze, and make important decisions about the uncertainty that comes with reaching their goals. Risk management allows individuals to reach their goals while mitigating or dealing with any of the associated losses.

How Can I Practice Risk Management in Personal Finance?

There are a few different steps that individuals can take to practice risk management in their personal finances. Start by identifying your goals, and then highlight the risks associated with your objectives. Once you know what the risks are, evaluate them and research the best ways to manage these risks. You will likely have to monitor and make adjustments to ensure you stay on top of your goals.

How Do Companies Manage Their Operational Risk?

Operational risk is any risk associated with the day-to-day operations of a business. Companies can manage it by identifying and assessing potential risks, measuring them, and putting controls in place to either mitigate or eliminate them altogether. It's also important that corporations monitor their operations and risk management techniques to see if they are working and make changes whenever necessary.

The Bottom Line

Risk is an important part of the financial world. The word often brings up feelings of negativity since there is the potential for capital and investment loss. But risk isn't always bad because investments that have more risk often come with the biggest rewards. Knowing what the risks are, how to identify them, and employing suitable risk management techniques can help mitigate losses while you reap the rewards.

What Is the Stock Market?

The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold. Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via

over-the-counter

(OTC) marketplaces that operate under a defined set of regulations.

Both “stock market” and “stock exchange” are often used interchangeably. Traders in the stock market buy or sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that are part of the overall stock market.

The leading U.S. stock exchanges include the

New York Stock Exchange

(NYSE) and the

Nasdaq

.

Key Takeaways

Stock markets are venues where buyers and sellers meet to exchange equity shares of public corporations.

Stock markets are components of a free-market economy because they enable democratized access to investor trading and exchange of capital.

Stock markets create efficient price discovery and efficient dealing.

The U.S. stock market is regulated by the

Securities and Exchange Commission

(SEC) and local regulatory bodies.

Ellen Lindner / Investopedia

Understanding the Stock Market

The stock market allows buyers and sellers of securities to meet, interact, and transact. The markets allow for price discovery for shares of corporations and serve as a barometer for

the overall economy

. Buyers and sellers are assured of a fair price, high degree of liquidity, and transparency as market participants compete in the open market.

The first stock market was the

London Stock Exchange

which began in a coffeehouse, where traders met to exchange shares, in 1773.

The first stock exchange in the United States began in Philadelphia in 1790.

The

Buttonwood Agreement

, so named because it was signed under a buttonwood tree, marked the beginning of New York’s Wall Street in 1792. The agreement was signed by 24 traders and was the first American organization of its kind to trade in securities. The traders renamed their venture the New York Stock and Exchange Board in 1817.

A stock market is a regulated and controlled environment. In the United States, the main regulators include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority

(FINRA).

The earliest stock markets issued and dealt in paper-based physical share certificates. Today, stock markets operate electronically.

Though it is called a stock market, other securities, such as

exchange-traded funds

(ETFs) are also traded in the stock market.

How the Stock Market Works

Stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares and other eligible financial instruments with confidence, with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the defined rules as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as

primary markets

and

secondary markets

.

As a primary market, the stock market allows companies to issue and sell their shares to the public for the first time through the process of an

initial public offering

(IPO). This activity helps companies raise necessary capital from investors.

A company divides itself into several shares and sells some of those shares to the public at a price per share.

To facilitate this process, a company needs a marketplace where these shares can be sold and this is achieved by the stock market. A listed company may also offer new, additional shares through other offerings at a later stage, such as through

rights issues

or

follow-on offerings

. They may even

buy back

or

delist

their shares.

Investors will own company shares in the expectation that share value will rise or that they will receive

dividend

payments or both. The stock exchange acts as a facilitator for this capital-raising process and receives a fee for its services from the company and its financial partners.

Using the stock exchanges, investors can also buy and sell securities they already own in what is called the secondary market.

The stock market or exchange maintains various market-level and sector-specific indicators, like the

S&P (Standard & Poor’s) 500 index

and the

Nasdaq 100 index

, which provide a measure to track the movement of the overall market.

Following an IPO, the stock exchange serves as a trading platform for buying and selling the outstanding shares. This constitutes the secondary market. The stock exchange earns a fee for every trade that occurs on its platform during secondary market activity.

What Are the Functions of a Stock Market?

The stock market ensures

price transparency

,

liquidity

,

price discovery

, and fair dealings in trading activities.

The stock market guarantees all interested market participants have access to data for all buy and sell orders, thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. The market also ensures efficient matching of appropriate buy and sell orders.

Stock markets need to support price discovery where the price of any stock is determined collectively by all of its buyers and sellers. Those qualified and willing to trade should get instant access to place orders and the market ensures that the orders are executed at a fair price.

Traders on the stock market include

market makers

,

investors

,

traders

,

speculators

, and hedgers. An investor may buy stocks and hold them for the long term, while a trader may enter and exit a position within seconds. A market maker provides necessary liquidity in the market, while a hedger may trade in

derivatives

.

How Stock Markets Are Regulated

Most nations have a stock market, and each is regulated by a local financial regulator or monetary authority, or institute. The SEC is the regulatory body charged with overseeing the U.S. stock market.

The SEC is a federal agency that works independently of the government and without political pressure. The mission of the SEC is stated as “protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.”

Companies listed on the stock market exchanges are regulated, and their dealings are monitored by the SEC. In addition, the exchanges set certain requirements such as mandating timely filing of quarterly financial reports and instant reporting of relevant corporate developments, to ensure that all market participants are equally informed.

Failure to adhere to the regulations can lead to suspension of trading and other disciplinary measures.

What Is the Significance of the Stock Market?

The stock market is a component of a free-market economy. It allows companies to raise money by offering stock shares and corporate bonds and allows investors to participate in the financial achievements of the companies, make profits through

capital gains

, and earn income through dividends. The stock market works as a platform through which savings and investments of individuals are efficiently channeled into productive investment opportunities and add to the capital formation and economic growth of the country.

What Is an Alternate Trading System?

Alternative trading systems

are venues for matching large buy and sell transactions and are not regulated like exchanges.

Dark pools

and many cryptocurrency exchanges are private exchanges or forums for securities and currency trading and operate within private groups.

Who Helps an Investor Trade on the Stock Market?

Stockbrokers

act as intermediaries between the stock exchanges and the investors by buying and selling stocks and

portfolio managers

are professionals who invest portfolios, or collections of securities, for clients.

Investment bankers

represent companies in various capacities, such as private companies that want to go public via an IPO or companies that are involved in pending mergers and acquisitions.

A

grantor

retained annuity trust (GRAT) is a special type of

irrevocable trust

that allows the trustmaker/grantor to gamble against the odds. If the trustmaker/grantor plays his cards right, then a significant amount of wealth can move down to the next generation with virtually no estate or gift tax ramifications.

How Does a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) Work?

Here is a general overview of how a GRAT works:

The trustmaker/grantor transfers specific assets into the name of the GRAT and, as the name suggests, retains the right to receive an annual

annuity payment for a certain number

of years. When the term of the GRAT ends, what is left in the GRAT is distributed to the trust beneficiaries (children or other beneficiaries of the trustmaker/grantor's choice).

The

amount of the annuity payment

that is required to be paid to the trustmaker/grantor during the term of the GRAT is calculated by using an interest rate the IRS determines monthly called the

section 7520 rate

. The section 7520 rate for January 2021 is 0.62%. The IRS tracks

historical

and current section 7520 rates.

The trustmaker/grantor can set the annuity payment so that it will be exactly equal to the section 7520 interest rate, meaning that all of the assets that have been transferred into the GRAT will theoretically be returned to the trustmaker/grantor in the form of the annuity payments and nothing will be left for distribution to the children or other beneficiaries when the GRAT ends. The transfer of assets owned by someone into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of someone else would ordinarily be deemed a gift for federal

gift tax

purposes, but with a GRAT, since theoretically all of the assets transferred in could come back to the trustmaker/grantor, the value of the gift to the beneficiaries of the GRAT will be at or close to $0. This is called a “zeroed-out GRAT.”

So why would someone set up a

trust for the benefit of someone else

but get all of the assets back in the form of annuity payments? This is where gambling against the odds comes into the picture. The trustmaker/grantor is really betting on the fact that the assets transferred into the GRAT will appreciate in value above and beyond the section 7520 interest rate. So while the trustmaker/grantor will receive the annuity payments, the beneficiaries of the GRAT will receive the underlying GRAT assets at their value. It's the value of those assets that will appreciate over and above the section 7520 rate.

The Drawbacks of Using a GRAT

Assets that are expected to appreciate greatly in value above can be transferred into a GRAT and in turn, move a significant amount of property down to the beneficiaries of the GRAT when the term ends. There are, however, two downsides to using a GRAT:

The assets transferred into the GRAT could grow at a rate lower than the section 7520 rate. If this is the case, then the trustmaker/grantor will simply receive back the trust property at its depreciated value and will only be out of the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.

The trustmaker/grantor could die during the term of the GRAT. If this is the case, then all of the property transferred into the GRAT would revert back into the estate of the trustmaker/grantor and be taxable for

estate tax

purposes, and the trustmaker/grantor will also be out the legal fees that were paid to set up the GRAT.

The Bottom Line

GRATs are not for everyone or just any type of asset. The trustmaker/grantor must be willing to take a gamble and bet that the property transferred into the GRAT will outperform the section 7520 interest rate, that the trustmaker/grantor will live to see the end of the term of the GRAT, and that the trustmaker/grantor will not need the

gifted property

later in life to pay for living expenses or long-term care.

Aside from the drawbacks discussed above, one other important thing to note is that President Obama fought GRATs as an estate reduction tool in his budget proposals throughout his time in office. The budget proposals addressed GRATs on two fronts: (1) GRATs would be required to have a minimum term of 10 years, which increases the chance that the trustmaker/grantor will die during the term of the trust and cause the GRAT assets to be pulled back into the trustmaker/grantor's

taxable estate

, and (2) zeroed-out GRATs would be eliminated. Instead, transfers into GRATs would be required to have a significant value for gift tax purposes. Both of these changes would have severely limited the effectiveness of GRATs as an estate tax reduction technique.

With the signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) by President Trump on Dec. 22, 2017, GRATs remained the same.

What Are Futures?

Futures are

derivative

financial contracts that obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date.

Underlying assets include physical commodities and financial instruments.

Futures contracts

detail the quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a

futures exchange

. Futures can be used for

hedging

or trade speculation.

Key Takeaways

Futures are derivative financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset at a predetermined future date and set price.

A futures contract allows an investor to speculate on the price of a financial instrument or commodity.

Futures are used to hedge the price movement of an underlying asset to help prevent losses from unfavorable price changes.

When you engage in hedging, you take a position opposite to the one you hold with the underlying asset; if you lose money on the underlying asset, the money you make on the futures contract can mitigate that loss.

Futures contracts trade on a futures exchange and a contract's price settles after the end of every trading session.

Understanding Futures

Futures—also called futures contracts—

allow traders to lock in the price

of the underlying asset or

commodity

. These contracts have expiration dates and set prices that are known upfront. Futures are identified by their expiration month. For example, a December gold futures contract expires in December.

Traders and investors use the term futures in reference to the overall asset class. However, there are many types of futures contracts available for trading including:

Commodity futures with underlying commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, corn, and wheat

Stock index futures with underlying assets such as the S&P 500 Index

Currency futures including those for the euro and the British pound

Precious metal futures for gold and silver

U.S. Treasury futures for bonds and other financial securities

It's important to note the

distinction between options and futures

.

American-style options

contracts give the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the

underlying asset

any time before the expiration date of the contract. With

European options

, you can only exercise at expiration but do not have to exercise that right.

The buyer of a futures contract, on the other hand, is obligated to take possession of the underlying commodity (or the financial equivalent) at the time of expiration and not any time before. The buyer of a futures contract can sell their position at any time before expiration and be free of their obligation. In this way, buyers of both options and futures contracts benefit from a leverage holder's position closing before the expiration date.

Pros

Investors can use futures contracts to speculate on the direction of the price of an underlying asset.

Companies can hedge the price of their raw materials or products they sell to protect against adverse price movements.

Futures contracts may only require a deposit of a fraction of the contract amount with a broker.

Cons

Investors risk losing more than the initial margin amount since futures use leverage.

Investing in a futures contract might cause a company that hedged to miss out on favorable price movements.

Margin can be a double-edged sword, meaning gains are amplified but so too are losses.

Using Futures

The futures markets typically use high

leverage

. Leverage means that the trader does not need to put up 100% of the contract's value amount when entering into a trade. Instead, the broker would require an

initial margin amount

, which consists of a fraction of the total contract value.

The amount required by the broker for a margin account can vary depending on the size of the futures contract, the creditworthiness of the investor, and the broker's terms and conditions.

The exchange where the futures contract trades will determine if the contract is for

physical delivery

or if it can be cash-settled. A corporation may enter into a physical delivery contract to lock in the price of a commodity it needs for production. However, many futures contracts involve traders who speculate on the trade. These contracts are closed out or netted—the difference in the original trade and closing trade price—and have a

cash settlement

.

Futures for Speculation

A futures contract allows a trader to speculate on the direction of a commodity's price. If a trader bought a futures contract and the price of the commodity rose and was trading above the original contract price at expiration, then they would have a profit. Before expiration, the futures contract—the

long position

—would be sold at the current price, closing the long position.

The difference between the prices would be cash-settled in the investor's brokerage account, and no physical product would change hands. However, the trader could also lose if the commodity's price was lower than the purchase price specified in the futures contract.

Speculators can also take a

short speculative position

if they predict the price of the underlying asset will fall. If the price does decline, the trader will take an

offsetting position

to close the contract. Again, the net difference would be settled at the expiration of the contract. An investor would realize a gain if the underlying asset's price was below the contract price and a loss if the current price was above the contract price.

It's important to note that

trading on margin

allows for a much larger position than the amount held by the brokerage account. As a result, margin investing can amplify gains, but it can also magnify losses.

Imagine a trader who has a $5,000 brokerage account balance and has a $50,000 position in crude oil. If the price of oil moves against the trade, it can mean losses that far exceed the account's $5,000 initial margin amount. In this case, the broker would make a

margin call

requiring that additional funds be deposited to cover the market losses.

Futures for Hedging

Futures can be used to

hedge

the price movement of the underlying asset. Here, the goal is to prevent losses from potentially unfavorable price changes rather than to speculate. Many companies that enter hedges are using—or in many cases producing—the underlying asset.

For example, corn farmers can use futures to lock in a specific price for selling their corn crop. By doing so, they reduce their risk and guarantee they will receive the fixed price. If the price of corn decreased, the farmer would have a gain on the hedge to offset losses from selling the corn at the market. With such a gain and loss offsetting each other, the hedging effectively locks in an acceptable

market price

.

Regulation of Futures

The futures markets are regulated by the

Commodity Futures Trading Commission

(CFTC). The CFTC is a federal agency created by Congress in 1974 to ensure the integrity of futures market pricing, including preventing abusive trading practices, fraud, and regulating brokerage firms engaged in futures trading.

Example of Futures

Let's say a trader wants to

speculate on the price of crude oil

by entering into a futures contract in May with the expectation that the price will be higher by year-end. The December crude oil futures contract is trading at $50 and the trader buys the contract.

Since oil is traded in increments of 1,000 barrels, the investor now has a position worth $50,000 of crude oil (1,000 x $50 = $50,000).

However, the trader will only need to pay a fraction of that amount up front—the initial margin that they deposit with the broker.

From May to December, the price of oil fluctuates as does the value of the futures contract. If oil's price gets too volatile, the broker may need to ask that additional funds to be deposited into the margin account. This is called

maintenance margin

.

In December, the end date of the contract is approaching (the third Friday of the month). The price of crude oil has risen to $65. The trader sells the original contract to exit the position. The net difference is cash-settled. They earn $15,000, less any fees and commissions owed the broker ($65 - $50 = $15 x 1000 = $15,000).

However, if the price oil had fallen to $40 instead, the investor would have lost $10,000 ($50 - $40 = a loss of $10 x 1000 = a loss of $10,000).

What Are Futures Contracts?

Futures contracts are an

investment vehicle

that allows the buyer to bet on the future price of a commodity or other security. There are many types of futures contracts available. These may have underlying assets such as oil, stock market indices, currencies, and agricultural products.

Unlike forward contracts, which are customized between the parties involved, futures contracts trade on organized exchanges such as those operated by the CME Group Inc. (CME). Futures contracts are popular among traders, who aim to profit on price swings, as well as commercial customers who wish to hedge their risks.

Are Futures a Type of Derivative?

Yes, futures contracts are a type of

derivative product

. They are derivatives because their value is based on the value of an underlying asset, such as oil in the case of crude oil futures. Like many derivatives, futures are a leveraged financial instrument, offering the potential for outsized gains or losses. As such, they are generally considered to be an advanced trading instrument and are usually traded only by experienced investors and institutions.

What Happens if You Hold a Futures Contract Until Expiration?

Oftentimes, traders who hold futures contracts until

expiration

will settle their position in cash. In other words, the trader will simply pay or receive a cash settlement depending on whether the underlying asset increased or decreased during the investment holding period.

In some cases, however, futures contracts will require physical delivery. In this scenario, the investor holding the contract upon expiration would take delivery of the underlying asset. They'd be responsible for the goods and covering costs for material handling, physical storage, and insurance.

What Is Forex (FX)?

Forex (FX) refers to the global electronic marketplace for trading international currencies and currency derivatives. It has no central physical location, yet the forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world by trading volume, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day. Most of the trading is done through banks, brokers, and financial institutions.

The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for holidays. The forex market is open on many holidays on which stock markets are closed, though the trading volume may be lower.

Its name, forex, is a portmanteau of foreign and exchange. It's often abbreviated as fx.

Key Takeaways

Forex (FX) market is a global electronic network for currency trading.

Formerly limited to governments and financial institutions, individuals can now directly buy and sell currencies on forex.

In the forex market, a profit or loss results from the difference in the price at which the trader bought and sold a currency pair.

Currency traders do not deal in cash. Brokers generally roll over their positions at the end of each day.

Understanding Forex (FX)

Forex traders use

various analysis techniques

to find the best entry and exit points for their trades. Forex exists so that large amounts of one currency can be exchanged for the equivalent value in another currency at the current market rate.

Some of these trades occur because financial institutions, companies, or individuals have a business need to exchange one currency for another. For example, an American company may trade U.S. dollars for Japanese yen in order to pay for merchandise that has been ordered from Japan and is payable in yen.

A great deal of forex trade exists to accommodate speculation on the direction of currency values. Traders profit from the price movement of a particular

pair of currencies

.

Forex Pairs and Quotes

Currencies being traded are listed in pairs, such as USD/CAD, EUR/USD, or USD/JPY. These represent the U.S. dollar (USD) versus the Canadian dollar (CAD), the Euro (EUR) versus the USD, and the USD versus the Japanese Yen (JPY), respectively.

There will also be a price associated with each pair, such as 1.2569. If this price was associated with the USD/CAD pair it means that it costs 1.2569 CAD to buy one USD. If the price increases to 1.3336, it now costs 1.3336 CAD to buy one USD. The USD has increased in value (the CAD has decreased) as it now costs more CAD to buy one USD.

Forex Lots

In the forex market, currencies trade in

lots

called micro, mini, and standard lots. A micro lot is 1,000 units of a given currency, a mini lot is 10,000, and a standard lot is 100,000.

This is obviously exchanging money on a larger scale than going to a bank to exchange $500 to take on a trip. When trading in the electronic forex market, trades take place in blocks of currency, and they can be traded in any volume desired, within the limits allowed by the individual trading account balance. For example, you can trade seven micro lots (7,000) or three mini lots (30,000), or 75 standard lots (7,500,000).

How Large Is the Forex?

The forex market is unique for several reasons, the main one being its size. Trading volume is generally very large. The Forex market trades over $5 trillion per day compared to $200 billion for the equities market.

The largest foreign exchange markets are located in major global financial centers including London, New York, Singapore, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and Sydney.

How to Trade Forex

The

forex market

is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, in major financial centers across the globe. This means that you can buy or sell currencies at virtually any hour.

In the past, forex trading was largely limited to governments, large companies, and hedge funds. Now, anyone can trade on forex. Many investment firms, banks, and retail brokers allow individuals to open accounts and trade currencies.

When trading in the forex market, you're buying or selling the currency of a particular country, relative to another currency. But there's no physical exchange of money from one party to another as at a foreign exchange kiosk.

In the world of electronic markets, traders usually take a position in a specific currency with the hope that there will be some upward movement and strength in the currency they're buying (or weakness if they're selling) so that they can make a profit.

A currency is always traded relative to another currency. If you sell a currency, you are buying another, and if you buy a currency you are selling another. The profit is made on the

difference between your transaction prices

.

Spot Transactions

A

spot market

deal is for immediate delivery, which is defined as two business days for most currency pairs. The major exception is the purchase or sale of USD/CAD, which is settled in one business day.

The business day excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in either currency of the traded pair. During the Christmas and Easter seasons, some spot trades can take as long as six days to settle. Funds are exchanged on the

settlement date

, not the

transaction date

.

The U.S. dollar is the

most actively traded currency.

The euro is the most actively traded

counter currency

, followed by the Japanese yen, British pound, and Chinese renminbi.

Market moves are driven by a combination of

speculation

, economic strength and growth, and interest rate differentials.

Forex Rollover

Retail traders don't typically want to take delivery of the currencies they buy. They are only interested in profiting from the difference between their transaction prices. Because of this, most retail brokers will automatically ""

roll over

"" their currency positions at 5 p.m. EST each day.

The broker basically resets the positions and provides either a credit or debit for the interest rate differential between the two currencies in the pairs being held. The trade carries on and the trader doesn't need to deliver or settle the transaction.

When the trade is closed the trader realizes a profit or loss based on the original transaction price and the price at which the trade was closed. The rollover credits or debits could either add to this gain or detract from it.

Since the forex market is closed on Saturday and Sunday, the interest rate credit or debit from these days is applied on Wednesday. Therefore, holding a position at 5 p.m. on Wednesday will result in being credited or debited triple the usual amount.

Forex Forward Transactions

Any forex transaction that settles for a date later than spot is considered a

forward

. The price is calculated by adjusting the spot rate to account for the difference in interest rates between the two currencies. The amount of adjustment is called ""forward points.""

The

forward points

reflect only the interest rate differential between two markets. They are not a forecast of how the spot market will trade at a date in the future.

A forward is a tailor-made contract. It can be for any amount of money and can settle on any date that's not a weekend or holiday. As in a spot transaction, funds are exchanged on the settlement date.

Forex Futures

A forex or

currency futures

contract is an agreement between two parties to deliver a set amount of currency at a set date, called the expiry, in the future. Futures contracts are traded on an exchange for set values of currency and with set expiry dates.

Unlike a forward, the terms of a futures contract are non-negotiable. A profit is made on the difference between the prices the contract was bought and sold at.

Most speculators don't hold futures contracts until expiration, as that would require they deliver/settle the currency the contract represents. Instead, speculators buy and sell the contracts prior to expiration, realizing their profits or losses on their transactions.

How Forex Differs From Other Markets

There are some major differences between the way the forex operates and other markets such as the U.S. stock market.

Fewer Rules

This means investors aren't held to as strict standards or regulations as those in the stock, futures, or options markets. There are no

clearinghouses

and no central bodies that oversee the entire forex market. You can short-sell at any time because in forex you aren't ever actually shorting; if you sell one currency you are buying another.

Fees and Commissions

Since the market is unregulated, fees and commissions vary widely among brokers. Most forex brokers make money by marking up the spread on currency pairs. Others make money by charging a commission, which fluctuates based on the amount of currency traded. Some brokers use both.

Full Access

There's no cut-off as to when you can and cannot trade. Because the market is open 24 hours a day, you can

trade at any time of day

. The exception is weekends, or when no global financial center is open due to a holiday.

Leverage

The forex market allows for

leverage

up to 1:50 in the U.S. and even higher in some parts of the world. That means a trader can open an account for $1,000 and buy or sell as much as $50,000 in currency. Leverage is a double-edged sword; it magnifies both profits and losses.

Example of Forex Transactions

Assume a trader believes that the EUR will appreciate against the USD. Another way of thinking of it is that the USD will fall relative to the EUR.

The trader buys the EUR/USD at 1.2500 and purchases $5,000 worth of currency. Later that day the price has increased to 1.2550. The trader is up $25 (5000 * 0.0050). If the price dropped to 1.2430, the trader would be losing $35 (5000 * 0.0070).

About the Rollover

Currency prices move constantly, so the trader may decide to hold the position overnight. The broker will roll over the position, resulting in a credit or debit based on the interest rate differential between the Eurozone and the U.S.

If the Eurozone has an interest rate of 4% and the U.S. has an interest rate of 3%, the trader owns the higher interest rate currency in this example. Therefore, at rollover, the trader should receive a small credit. If the EUR interest rate was lower than the USD rate, the trader would be debited at rollover.

Rollover can affect a trading decision, especially if the trade can be held for the long term. Large differences in interest rates can result in significant credits or debits each day, which can greatly enhance or erode profits (or increase or reduce losses) of the trade.

Most brokers provide leverage. Many U.S. brokers leverage up to 1:50. Let's assume our trader uses 1:10 leverage on this transaction. If using 10:1 leverage the trader is not required to have $5,000 in an account, even while trading $5,000 worth of currency. Only $500 is needed.

In this example, a profit of $25 can be made quite quickly considering the trader only needs $500 or $250 of trading capital (or even less if using more leverage). That shows the power of leverage. The flip side is that the trader could lose the capital just as quickly.

Is Forex Trading for Beginners?

Forex trading can be risky and complex, involving quick decisions due to how fast exchange rates change. It is likely not suited for beginner traders; however, traders can spend time learning forex trading with test trading or with low levels of capital.

How Much Do You Need to Start Trading Forex?

You can start trading Forex with around $100. This will be enough to get you started in buying and selling currencies. It is also a good level for beginners as it isn't a very large amount of capital to lose.

What Are the Risks of Forex Trading?

There are many risks to forex trading. Exchange rates are very volatile, changing often, which could quickly impact a trade. There is also a significant amount of leverage involved in FX, meaning small movements can result in large losses. In addition, there is transaction risk, interest rate risk, and country risk.

The Bottom Line

Forex is foreign exchange, which refers to the global trading of currencies and currency derivatives. It is the largest financial market in the world, involving the buying and selling of currencies in pairs, taking advantage of changing rates.

What Is Diversification?

Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt to

limit exposure to any single asset or risk

.

The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.

Key Takeaways

Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in an attempt to reduce portfolio risk.

Diversification is most often done by investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrency.

Diversification can also be achieved by purchasing investments in different countries, industries, sizes of companies, or term lengths for income-generating investments.

The quality of diversification in a portfolio is most often measured by analyzing the correlation coefficient of pairs of assets.

Investors can diversify on their own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds.

Understanding Diversification

Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness.

Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the

negative performance

of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly

correlated

—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.

Diversification Strategies

As investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. Many of the methods below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio.

Asset Classes

Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Each asset class has a different, unique set of risks and opportunities. Classes can include:

Stocks

: Shares or equity in a publicly traded company

Bonds

: Government and corporate fixed-income debt instruments

Real estate

: Land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

: A marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector

Commodities

: Basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services

Cash and short-term cash-equivalents (CCE)

: Treasury bills, certificate of deposit (CD), money market vehicles, and other short-term, low-risk investments

The theory holds that what may negatively impact one asset class may benefit another. For example, rising interest rates usually negatively impact bond prices as yield must increase to make fixed income securities more attractive. On the other hand, rising interest rates may result in increases in rent for real estate or increases in prices for commodities.

Industries/Sectors

There are tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. As investors diversify across various industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk.

For example, consider the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.

This legislation impacts many industries, though some companies are more affected than others.

Semiconductor

manufacturers will be largely impacted, while the financial services sector might feel smaller, residual impacts.

Investors can diversify across industries by coupling investments that may counterbalance different businesses. For example, consider two major means of entertainment: travel and digital streaming. Investors hoping to hedge against the risk of future major pandemic impacts may invest in digital streaming platforms (positively impacted by more shutdowns). At the same time, they may consider simultaneously investing in airlines (positively impacted by fewer shutdowns). In theory, these two unrelated industries may minimize overall portfolio risk.

How many stocks do you need to own to be properly diversified? A study published in the

Journal of Risk and Financial Management

found there are simply too many variables to consider, and ""an optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist.""

Corporate Lifecycle Stages (Growth vs. Value)

Public equities tend to be broken into two categories:

growth stocks

and

value stocks

. Growth stocks are stocks in companies that are expected to experience profit or revenue growth greater than the industry average. Value stocks are stocks in companies that appear to be trading at a discount based on the current fundamentals of a company.

Growth stocks tend to be more risky as the expected growth of a company may not materialize. For example, if the Federal Reserve constricts monetary policy, less capital is usually available (or it is more expensive to borrow), creating a more difficult scenario for growth companies. However, growth companies may tap into seemingly limitless potential and exceed expectations, generating even greater returns than expected.

On the other hand, value stocks tend to be more established, stable companies. While these companies may have already experienced most of their potential, they usually carry less risk. By diversifying into both, an investor would capitalize on the future potential of some companies while also recognizing the existing benefits of others.

Market Capitalizations (Large vs. Small)

Investors may want to consider investing across different securities based on the underlying

market capitalization

of the asset or company. Consider the vast operational differences between Apple and Newell Brands Inc. In July 2023, both companies were in the S&P 500, with Apple representing 7.6% of the index and Newell Brands representing 0.0065%.

Each company will have a considerably different approach to raising capital, introducing new products to the market, brand recognition, and growth potential. Lower cap stocks have more room to grow, though higher cap stocks tend to be safer investments.

Risk Profiles

Across almost every asset class, investors can choose the underlying risk profile of the security. For example, consider fixed-income securities. An investor can choose to buy bonds from the top-rated governments in the world or from nearly defunct private companies raising

emergency funds

. There are considerable differences between several 10-year bonds based on the issuer, their credit rating, future operational outlook, and existing level of debt.

The same can be said for other types of investments. Real estate development projects with more risk may carry greater upside than established operating properties. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies with longer histories and greater adoption, such as Bitcoin, carry less risk relative to smaller market cap coins or tokens.

Diversification may not be the best strategy for investors wanting to maximize their returns. Consider ""YOLO"" (you only live once) strategies where 100% of capital is placed in a high-risk investment. Though there is a higher probability of making life-changing money, there is also the highest probability of losing it due to poor diversification.

Maturity Lengths

Specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds, different term lengths impact risk profiles. Generally, the longer the

maturity

, the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bond's prices due to changes in interest rates. Short-term bonds tend to offer lower interest rates; however, they also tend to be less impacted by uncertainty in future yield curves. Investors more comfortable with risk may consider adding longer term bonds that tend to pay higher degrees of interest.

Maturity length is also prevalent in other asset classes. Consider the difference between short-term lease agreements for residential properties (i.e., up to one year) and long-term lease agreements for commercial properties (i.e., sometimes five years or greater). Though there is more security in collecting rent revenue by locking into a long-term agreement, investors sacrifice flexibility to increase prices or change tenants.

Physical Locations (Foreign vs. Domestic)

Investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japan's economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn.

Alternatively, there may be a greater potential upside (with associated higher degrees of risk) when diversifying across developed and emerging countries. Consider Pakistan's current classification as a

frontier market

participant (recently downgraded from an emerging market participant).

Investors willing to take on higher levels of risk may want to consider the higher growth potential of smaller yet-to-be-fully established markets such as Pakistan.

Tangibility

Financial instruments such as stocks and bonds are intangible investments; they can not be physically touched or felt. On the other hand, tangible investments such as land, real estate, farmland, precious metals, or commodities can be touched and have real-world applications. These

real assets

have different investment profiles as they can be consumed, rented, developed, or treated differently than intangible or digital assets.

There are also unique risks specific to tangible assets. Real property can be vandalized, physically stolen, damaged by natural conditions, or become obsolete. Real assets may also require storage, insurance, or security costs to carry. Though the revenue stream differs from financial instruments, the input costs to protect tangible assets are also different.

Diversification Across Platforms

Regardless of how an investor considers building their portfolio, another aspect of diversification relates to how those assets are held. Though this is not an implication of the investment's risk, it is an additional risk worth considering as it may be diversifiable.

For example, consider an individual with $400,000 of U.S. currency. In all three of the situations below, the investor has the same asset allocation. However, their risk profile is different:

The individual may deposit $200,000 at one bank and $200,000 at a second bank. Both deposits are under the

FDIC

insurance limit per bank and are fully insured.

The individual may deposit $400,000 at a single bank. Only a portion of the deposit is covered by insurance. In addition, should that single bank experience a bank run, the individual may not have immediate access to cash.

The individual may physically store $400,000 of cash in their home. Though immediately accessible, the individual will not yield any interest or growth on their cash. In addition, the individual may lose capital in the event of theft, fire, or by misplacing it.

The same concept above relates to almost every asset class. For example, Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy in July 2022.

Investors holding cryptocurrency with the exchange experienced the inability to withdraw or transfer funds. Had investors diversified across platforms, the risk of loss would have been spread across different exchanges.

Consider different strategies to offset technology risk and physical risk. For example, owning physical gold bars and gold ETFs diversifies your portfolio across various risks. If your physical holdings were to be stolen, at least 100% of your gold ownership was not lost.

Diversification and Retail Investors

Time and budget constraints can make it difficult for noninstitutional investors—i.e., individuals—to create an adequately diversified portfolio. This challenge is a key to why mutual funds are so popular with retail investors. Buying shares in a mutual fund offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments.

While mutual funds provide diversification across various asset classes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) afford investor access to narrow markets, such as commodities and international plays, that would ordinarily be difficult to access. An individual with a $100,000 portfolio can spread the investment among ETFs with no overlap.

There are several reasons why this is advantageous to investors. First, it may be too costly for retail investors to buy securities using different market orders. In addition, investors must then track their portfolio's weight to ensure proper diversification. Though an investor sacrifices a say in all of the underlying companies being invested in, they simply choose an easier investment approach that prioritizes minimizing risk.

Pros and Cons of Diversification

The primary purpose of diversification is to mitigate risk. By spreading your investment across different asset classes, industries, or maturities, you are less likely to experience market shocks that impact every single one of your investments the same.

There are other benefits to be had as well. Some investors may find diversification makes investing more fun as it encourages exploring different unique investments. Diversification may also increase the chance of hitting positive news. Instead of hoping for favorable news specific to one company, positive news impacting one of dozens of companies may benefit your portfolio.

However, there are drawbacks to diversification. The more holdings a portfolio has, the more time-consuming it can be to manage—and the more expensive, since buying and selling many different holdings incurs more transaction fees and brokerage commissions. More fundamentally, diversification's spreading-out strategy works both ways, lessening the risk and the reward.

For instance, imagine you've invested $120,000 equally among six stocks, and one stock doubles in value. Your original $20,000 stake is now worth $40,000. You've made a lot, sure, but not as much as if your entire $120,000 had been invested in that one company. By protecting you on the downside, diversification limits you on the upside—at least in the short term.

Pros

Reduces portfolio risk

Hedges against market volatility

Offers potentially higher returns long-term

May be more enjoyable for investors to research new investments

Cons

Limits gains short-term

Time-consuming to manage

Incurs more transaction fees, commissions

May be overwhelming for newer, unexperienced investors

Diversifiable vs. Non-Diversifiable Risk

The idea behind diversification is to minimize (or even eliminate) risk within a portfolio. However, there are certain types of risks you can diversify away, and certain types of risks exist regardless of how you diversify. These types of risks are called

unsystematic

and

systematic risks

.

Consider the impact of COVID-19. Due to the global health crisis, many businesses stopped operating. Employees across many industries were laid off, and consumer spending across all sectors declined. On one hand, the economic slowdown negatively impacted almost every sector. On the other, nearly every sector then benefited from government intervention and monetary stimulus. The impact of COVID-19 on financial markets was systematic.

In general, diversification aims to reduce unsystematic risk. These are the risks specific to an investment that are unique to that holding. Examples of diversifiable, non-systematic risks include:

Business risk

:

The risk related to a specific company based on the nature of its company and what it does in the market.

Financial risk

: The risks related to a specific company or organization's financial health, liquidity, and long-term solvency.

Operational risk

: The risk related to breakdowns in manufacturing or goods distribution processes.

Regulatory risk

: The risk that legislation may adversely impact the asset.

Through diversification, investors strive to reduce the risks above, which are controllable based on the investments held.

Measuring Diversification

It can become complex and cumbersome to measure how diversified a portfolio is. In reality, it is impossible to calculate the actual degree of diversification; there are simply too many variables to consider across too many assets to truly quantify a single measure of diversification. Still, analysts and portfolio managers use several measurements to get a rough idea of how diversified a portfolio is.

Correlation Coefficient

A

correlation coefficient

is a statistical measurement that compares the relationship between two variables. This statistical calculation tracks the movement of two assets and whether the assets tend to move in the same direction. The correlation coefficient result varies from -1 to 1, with interpretations ranging from:

Closer to -1

:

There is strong diversification between the two assets, as the investments move in opposite directions. There is a strong negative correlation between the two variables being analyzed.

Closer to 0

: There is moderate diversification between the two assets, as the investments have no correlation. The assets sometimes move together, while other times, they don't.

Closer to 1

: There is a strong lack of diversification between the two assets, as the investments move in the same direction. There is a strong positive correlation between the two variables being analyzed.

Standard Deviation

Standard deviation

(SD) measures how often and far an outcome occurs away from the mean. For investments, standard deviation measures how far away from an asset's average return other returns fall. Analysts use SD to estimate risk based on return frequency.

For example, imagine two investments, each with an average annual return of 5%. One has a high standard deviation, which means the investment returns can vary greatly. The other investment has a low standard deviation, meaning its returns have been closer to 5%. The higher the standard deviation, the more risk there is—but there is a chance for higher returns.

A portfolio full of investments with high standard deviations may have higher earning potential. However, these assets may be more likely to experience similar risks across asset classes.

Smart Beta

Smart beta strategies

offer diversification by tracking underlying indices but do not necessarily weigh stocks according to their market cap. ETF managers further screen equity issues on fundamentals and rebalance portfolios according to objective analysis, not just company size. While smart beta portfolios are unmanaged, the primary goal becomes the outperformance of the index itself.

Count/Weighting

In its most basic form, a portfolio's diversification can be measured by counting the number of assets or determining the weight of each asset. When counting the number of assets, consider the number of each type for the strategies above. For example, an investor can count that of the 20 equities they hold, 15 are in the technology sector.

Alternatively, investors can measure diversification by allocating percentages to what they are invested in. So, in this view, the investor with 15 equities in tech has 75% of their equity holdings in a single industry.

On a broader portfolio basis, investors more often compare equity, bonds, and alternative assets to create their diversification targets. For example, traditional portfolios tended to skew towards 60% equities and 40% bonds—though some strategies call for different diversification based on age. Other theories claim that holding alternative assets has added benefits (for example, 60% equities, 20% bonds, and 20% alternatives).

Example of Diversification

Imagine an

aggressive investor

, who can assume a higher risk level, wishes to construct a portfolio composed of Japanese equities, Australian bonds, and cotton futures. They could purchase stakes in the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, the Vanguard Australian Government Bond Index ETF, and the iPath Bloomberg Cotton Subindex Total Return ETN.

With this mix of ETF shares, due to the specific qualities of the targeted asset classes and the transparency of the holdings, the investor ensures true diversification in their holdings. Also, with different correlations, or responses to outside forces, among the securities, they can slightly lessen their risk exposure.

What Are the Benefits of Diversification?

In theory, holding investments that are different from each other reduces the overall risk of the assets you're invested in. If something bad happens to one investment, you're more likely to have assets that are not impacted if you were diversified. Diversification may result in a larger profit if you are extended into asset classes you wouldn't otherwise have invested in. Also, some investors find diversification more enjoyable to pursue as they research new companies, explore different asset classes, and own different types of investments.

What Are the Methods of Diversification?

There are many different ways to diversify; the primary method of diversification is to buy different types of asset classes. For example, instead of putting your entire portfolio into public stock, you may consider buying some bonds to offset some market risk of stocks.

In addition to investing in different asset classes, you can diversify into different industries, geographical locations, term lengths, or market caps. The primary goal of diversification is to invest in a broad range of assets that face different risks.

Is Diversification a Good Strategy?

For investors seeking to minimize risk, diversification is a strong strategy. That said, diversification may minimize returns, as the goal of diversification is to reduce the risk within a portfolio. By reducing risk, an investor is willing to take less profit in exchange for the preservation of capital.

The Bottom Line

Diversification is a very important concept in financial planning and investment management. It is the idea that by investing in different things, the overall risk of your portfolio is lower.

Instead of putting all your money into a single asset, spreading your wealth across different assets puts you at less risk of losing capital. With the ease of transacting and investing online, it is now incredibly easy to diversify your portfolio through different asset classes and other strategies.

Investopedia / Joules Garcia

Asset allocation is how investors divide their portfolios among different assets that might include equities, fixed-income assets, and cash and its equivalents. Investors ordinarily aim to balance risks and rewards based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and the investment horizon.

Key Takeaways

Asset allocation is how investors split up their portfolios among different kinds of assets.

The three main asset classes are equities, fixed income, and cash and cash equivalents.

Each asset class has different risks and return potential, so each will behave differently over time.

No simple formula can find the right asset allocation for every individual investor.

Why Is Asset Allocation Important?

There's no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone, but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors make.

Selecting individual securities within an asset class is done only after you decide how to divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. This will largely determine your investment results.

Investors use different asset allocations for distinct goals. Someone saving to buy a new car in the next year might invest those savings in a conservative mix of cash, certificates of deposit, and

short-term bonds

. However, individuals saving for retirement decades away typically invest most of their retirement accounts in stocks because they have a lot of time to ride out the market's short-term fluctuations.

Risk tolerance plays a key factor as well. Those uncomfortable investing in stocks may put their money in a more conservative asset class despite having a long-term investment horizon.

Age-Based Asset Allocation

Financial advisors generally recommend holding stocks for five years or longer. Cash and

money market accounts

are appropriate for goals less than a year away. Bonds fall somewhere in between.

Financial advisors once recommended subtracting an investor's age from 100 to determine what percentage should be invested in stocks. A 40-year-old would, therefore, be 60% invested in stocks. Variations of this rule recommend subtracting age from 110 or 120, given that average life expectancy continues to grow.

Portfolios should generally move to a more conservative asset allocation to help lower risk as individuals approach retirement.

Asset Allocation Through Life-Cycle Funds

Some asset-allocation

mutual funds

are known as life-cycle or target-date funds. They set out to provide investors with portfolios that address their age, risk appetite, and investment goals with the correlated parts of different asset classes. Critics of this approach point out that a standardized solution for allocating portfolio assets is wrongheaded because individual investors require individual solutions.

These funds gradually reduce the risk in their portfolios as they near the target date, cutting riskier stocks and adding safer bonds to preserve the nest egg. The Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 is an example of a target-date fund.

The

Vanguard 2030 fund

is for people expecting to retire just before or after 2030. As of Aug. 31, 2023, its portfolio comprises 63% stocks, 36% bonds, and 1% short-term reserves. This asset allocation was achieved by investing in the following four funds:

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares

Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares

Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund

How Do Economic Changes Affect Asset Allocation Strategies?

Economic cycles of growth and contraction greatly affect how you should allocate your assets. During bull markets, investors ordinarily prefer growth-oriented assets like stocks to profit from better market conditions. Alternatively, during downturns or recessions, investors tend to shift toward more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents, which can help preserve capital.

What Is an Asset Allocation Fund?

An asset allocation fund provides investors with a diversified portfolio of investments across various asset classes. The asset allocation of the fund can be fixed or variable among a mix of asset classes. It may be held to fixed percentages of asset classes or allowed to lean further on some, depending on market conditions.

What Is a Good Asset Allocation?

What works for one person might not work for another. There is no such thing as a perfect asset allocation model. A good asset allocation varies by individual and can depend on various factors, including age, financial targets, and appetite for risk. Historically, an asset allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds was considered optimal. However, some professionals say this idea needs to be revised, particularly given the poorer performance of bonds in recent years, and say other asset classes should also be introduced to portfolios.

What Is the Best Asset Allocation Strategy for My Age?

Generally, the younger and further you are from needing to access the capital invested, the more you should invest in stocks. One common guideline that’s ordinarily quoted is that you should hold a percentage of stocks that is equal to 100 minus your age. So, if you are 30, 70% of your portfolio should supposedly consist of stocks. The rest would then be allocated to safer assets, such as bonds. But a lot of these rules don't work for everyone. For advice that reflects your personal circumstances, reach out to a financial advisor.

How Does Behavioral Finance View Asset Allocation?

Behavioral finance explores how common cognitive errors might influence our financial choices. For our asset allocation, we might be swayed too much by recent market trends, overconfidence, sunk-cost reasoning, or loss aversion, which can lead to less beneficial allocation choices. Awareness of these cognitive biases can help you keep a disciplined, long-term approach aligned with your goals.

The Bottom Line

Most financial professionals will tell you that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors can make. The selection of individual securities is secondary to how assets are allocated in stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents, which will play more of a role in your investment results.

What Is Value Investing?

Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking

stocks

that appear to be trading for less than their

intrinsic

or book value. Value investors actively ferret out stocks they think the

stock market

is underestimating. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term

fundamentals

. The overreaction offers an opportunity to profit by purchaing stocks at discounted prices.

Warren Buffett

is probably the best-known value investor today, but there are many others, including

Benjamin Graham

(Buffett's professor and mentor), David Dodd,

Charlie Munger

(Buffet's business partner), Christopher Browne (another Graham student), and billionaire

hedge-fund manager

, Seth Klarman.

Investopedia / Sydney Saporito

Understanding Value Investing

The basic concept behind everyday value investing is straightforward: If you know the true value of something, you can save a lot of money when you buy it. Most folks would agree that whether you buy a new TV on sale, or at full price, you’re getting the same TV with the same screen size and picture quality.

Stock prices work in a similar manner, meaning a company’s share price can change even when the company’s valuation has remained the same. This means, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a true, or intrinsic, value of the stock of a given company. But there are relative values.

Market participants can buy or sell shares without being tethered to an objective price figure. Therefore, stocks, like TVs, go through periods of higher and lower demand leading to price fluctuations. If the company's fundamentals are the same, and its future opportunities are unchanged, then the value of the shares is largely the same even though the price differs.

Value investing developed from a concept by Columbia Business School professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in 1934 and was popularized in Graham's 1949 book, ""The Intelligent Investor

.""

Just like savvy shoppers would argue that it makes no sense to pay full price for a TV since TVs go on sale several times a year, savvy value investors believe stocks work the same way. Of course, unlike TVs, stocks won't go on sale at predictable times of the year such as

Black Friday

, and their sale prices won’t be advertised.

Value investing is the

process of doing detective work

to find these secret sales on stocks and buying them at a discount compared to how the market values them. In return for buying and holding these value stocks for the long term, investors can be rewarded handsomely.

Intrinsic Value and Value Investing

In the stock market, the equivalent of a stock being cheap or discounted is when its shares are

undervalued

. Value investors hope to profit from shares they perceive to be deeply discounted.

Investors use various metrics to attempt to find the valuation or

intrinsic value

of a stock. Intrinsic value is a combination of using financial analysis, such as studying a company's financial performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, profit, and fundamental factors. It includes the company's brand, business model, target market, and competitive advantage. Some metrics used to value a company's stock include:

Price-to-book

(P/B), which measures the value of a company's assets and compares them to the stock price. If the price is lower than the value of the assets, the stock is undervalued, assuming the company is not in financial hardship.

Price-to-earnings

(P/E), which shows the company's track record for earnings to determine if the stock price is not reflecting all of the earnings or is undervalued.

Free cash flow

, which is the cash generated from a company's revenue or operations after the costs of expenditures have been subtracted.

Free cash flow is the cash remaining after expenses have been paid, including

operating expenses

and large purchases called

capital expenditures

, which is the purchase of assets like equipment or upgrading a manufacturing plant. If a company is generating free cash flow, it'll have money left over to invest in the future of the business, pay off debt, pay

dividends

or rewards to shareholders, and issue

share buybacks

.

Of course, there are

many other metrics

used in the analysis, including analyzing debt, equity, sales, and revenue growth. After reviewing these metrics, the value investor can decide to purchase shares if the comparative value—the stock's current price vis-a-vis its company's intrinsic worth—is attractive enough.

Margin of Safety

Value investors require some room for error in their estimation of value, and they often set their own ""

margin of safety

"" based on their particular risk tolerance. The margin of safety principle, one of the keys to successful value investing, is based on the premise that buying stocks at bargain prices gives you a better chance of earning a profit later when you sell them. The margin of safety also makes you less likely to lose money if the stock doesn't perform as you had expected.

So, if you believe a stock is worth $100 and buy it for $66, you'll make a profit of $34 simply by waiting for the stock's price to rise to the $100 true value. On top of that, the company might grow and become more valuable, giving you a chance to make even more money. If the stock's price rises to $110, you'll make $44 since you bought the stock on sale. If you had purchased it at its full price of $100, you would only make a $10 profit.

Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, only bought stocks when they were priced at two-thirds or less of their intrinsic value. This was the margin of safety he felt was necessary to earn the best returns while minimizing investment downside.

Value Investors Believe the Markets Are Not Efficient

Value investors don't believe in the

efficient-market hypothesis

, which says that stock prices already take all information about a company into account, so their price always reflects their value. Instead, value investors believe that stocks may be over or underpriced for various reasons.

For example, a stock might be underpriced because the economy is performing poorly and investors are panicking and selling (as was the case during the Great Recession). Or a stock might be overpriced because investors have gotten too excited about an unproven new technology (as was the case of the dot-com bubble). Psychological biases can push a stock price up or down based on news, such as disappointing or unexpected earnings announcements, product recalls, or litigation. Stocks may also be undervalued because they trade under the radar, meaning analysts and the media inadequately cover them.

Value Investors Don't Follow the Herd

Value investors possess many characteristics of

contrarians

—they don’t follow the herd. Not only do they reject the efficient-market hypothesis, but when everyone else is buying, they’re often selling or standing back. When everyone else is selling, they’re buying or holding. Value investors don’t buy trendy stocks (because they’re typically overpriced). Instead, they invest in companies that aren’t household names if the financials check out. They also take a second look at stocks that are household names when those stocks’ prices have plummeted, believing such companies can recover from setbacks if their fundamentals remain strong and their products and services still have quality.

Value investors only care about a stock’s intrinsic value. They think about buying a stock for what it actually is: a percentage of ownership in a company. They want to own companies that they know have sound principles and sound financials, regardless of what everyone else is saying or doing.

Value Investing Requires Diligence and Patience

Estimating the true intrinsic value of a stock involves some financial analysis but also involves a fair amount of subjectivity—meaning at times, it can be more of an art than a science. Two different investors can analyze the exact same valuation data on a company and arrive at different decisions. So, you'll need to develop a strategy that works for you.

Find a Preferred Method

Some investors, who look only at existing financials, don't put much faith in estimating future growth. Other value investors focus primarily on a company's future growth potential and estimated

cash flows

. Some do both: Noted value investment gurus

Warren Buffett

and Peter Lynch, who ran Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund for several years are both known for analyzing financial statements and looking at valuation multiples, in order to identify cases where the market has mispriced stocks.

Purchase for Less

Despite different approaches, the underlying logic of value investing is to purchase assets for less than they are currently worth, hold them for the long-term, and profit when they return to the intrinsic value or above. It doesn't provide instant gratification. You can’t expect to buy a stock for $50 on Tuesday and sell it for $100 on Thursday. Instead, you may have to wait years before your stock investments pay off, and you will occasionally lose money. The good news is that, for most investors, long-term

capital gains

are taxed at a lower rate than short-term investment gains.

Play the Waiting Game

Like all investment strategies, you must have the patience and diligence to stick with your investment philosophy. Some stocks you might want to buy because the fundamentals are sound, but you'll have to wait if it's overpriced. You'll want to buy the stock that is most attractively priced at that moment, and if no stocks meet your criteria, you'll have to sit and wait and let your cash sit idle until an opportunity arises.

Why Stocks Become Undervalued

If you don’t believe in the efficient market hypothesis, you can identify reasons why stocks might be

trading below their intrinsic value

. Here are a few factors that can drag a stock’s price down and make it undervalued.

Market Moves and Herd Mentality

Sometimes, people invest irrationally based on psychological biases rather than market fundamentals. When a specific stock’s price is rising or when the overall market is rising, they buy. They see that if they had invested 12 weeks ago, they could have earned 15% by now, and they develop a fear of missing out.

Conversely, when a stock’s price is falling or when the overall market is declining, loss aversion compels people to sell their stocks. So, instead of keeping their losses on paper and waiting for the market to change directions, they accept a certain loss by selling. Such investor behavior is so widespread that it affects the prices of individual stocks, exacerbating both upward and downward market movements and creating excessive moves.

Market Crashes

A ""bubble"" is the result of investor exuberance, with prices growing ever higher. When the market reaches an unbelievable high, it usually results in the

bubble bursting

. Because the price levels are unsustainable, investors end up panicking and selling off related assets en masse. This results in a market crash. That's what happened in the early 2000s with the dot-com bubble when the values of tech stocks shot up beyond what the companies were worth. We saw the same thing happen when the housing bubble burst in 2006, and the market crashed in the following years.

Unnoticed and Unglamorous Stocks

Look beyond what you're hearing in the news. You may find really great investment opportunities in undervalued stocks that may not be on people's radars, like

small caps

or even foreign stocks.

Most investors want in on the next big thing, such as a technology startup, instead of a boring, established consumer durables manufacturer.

For example, stocks like Meta (formerly Facebook), Apple, and Google are more likely to be affected by herd-mentality investing than

conglomerates

like Proctor & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson.

Bad News

Even good companies face setbacks, such as litigation and recalls. However, just because a company experiences one adverse event doesn't mean it isn't still fundamentally valuable or that its stock won't bounce back. In other cases, there may be a segment or division that puts a dent in a company's profitability. But that can change if the company decides to dispose of or close that arm of the business.

Analysts do not have a great track record for predicting the future, yet investors often panic and sell when a company announces earnings that are lower than

analysts' expectations

. But value investors who can see beyond the downgrades and negative news can buy stock at deeper discounts because they can recognize a company's long-term value.

Cyclicality​

Cyclicality is defined as the fluctuations that affect a business. Companies are not immune to ups and downs in the economic cycle, whether that's seasonality and the time of year or consumer attitudes and moods. All of this can affect profit levels and the price of a company's stock, but it doesn't affect its long-term value.

Value Investing Strategies

The key to buying an undervalued stock is to thoroughly research the company and make common-sense decisions. Value investor Christopher H. Browne recommends asking if a company is likely to increase its revenue via the following methods:

Raising prices on products

Increasing sales figures

Decreasing expenses

Selling off or closing down unprofitable divisions

Browne also suggests studying a company's competitors to evaluate its future growth prospects. But the answers to all of these questions tend to be speculative, without any real supportive numerical data. Simply put, no quantitative software programs are yet available to help achieve these answers, making value stock investing somewhat of a grand guessing game. For this reason, Warren Buffett recommends investing only in industries you have personally worked in or whose consumer goods you are familiar with, like cars, clothes, appliances, and food.

One thing investors can do is choose the stocks of companies that sell high-demand products and services. While it's difficult to predict when innovative new products will capture market share, it's easy to gauge how long a company has been in business and study how it has adapted to challenges over time.

Insider Buying and Selling

For our purposes,

insiders

are the company’s senior managers and directors, plus any shareholders who own at least 10% of the company’s stock.

A company’s managers and directors have unique knowledge about the companies they run, so if they are purchasing its stock, it’s reasonable to assume that the company’s prospects look favorable.

Likewise, investors who own at least 10% of a company’s stock wouldn’t have bought so much if they didn’t see profit potential. Conversely, a stock sale by an insider doesn’t necessarily point to bad news about the company’s anticipated performance—the insider might simply need cash for any number of personal reasons. Nonetheless, if mass sell-offs are occurring by insiders, such a situation may warrant further in-depth analysis of the reason behind the sale.

Analyze Financial Reports

At some point, value investors have to look at a company's financials to see how its performing and compare it to industry peers.

Financial reports present a company’s annual and quarterly performance results. The annual report is SEC Form 10-K, and the quarterly report is

SEC Form 10-Q

. Companies are required to file these reports with the

Securities and Exchange Commission

(SEC).

You can find them on the SEC website or the company’s investor relations page on their website.

You can learn a lot from a company’s annual report. It will explain the products and services offered as well as where the company is heading.

Financial Statements

Financial statements are generally included in a company's financial reports to regulators, but they provide a big-picture view of the company's financial condition. There are three statements publicly traded companies are required to file—the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows.

Balance Sheet

The

balance sheet

consists of two sections, one listing the company’s assets and another listing its liabilities and equity. The assets section is broken down into a company’s cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable or money owed from customers, inventories, and fixed assets such as plant and equipment.

The liabilities section lists the company’s accounts payable or money owed,

accrued liabilities

, short-term debt, and long-term debt. The shareholders’ equity section reflects how much money is invested in the company, how many shares are outstanding, and how much the company has in

retained earnings

. Retained earnings is a type of savings account that holds the cumulative profits from the company. Retained earnings are used to pay dividends, for example, and are considered a sign of a healthy, profitable company.

Income Statement

The

income statement

tells you how much revenue is being generated, the company's expenses, and profits. Looking at the annual income statement rather than a quarterly statement will give you a better idea of the company’s overall position since many companies experience fluctuations in sales volume during the year.

Statement of Cash Flows

The statement of cash flows lists everywhere cash came from and went to in a company. It tells you which activities created inflow, such as operating, investing, or financing activities. It also lists which of these activities created outflows.

Studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market over the long term.

Couch Potato Value Investing

It is possible to become a value investor without ever reading a

10-K

. Couch potato investing is a passive strategy of buying and holding a few investing vehicles for which someone else has already done the investment analysis—i.e., mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. In the case of value investing, those funds would be those that follow the value strategy and buy value stocks—or track the moves of high-profile value investors like Warren Buffett.

Investors can buy shares of his holding company,

Berkshire Hathaway

, which owns or has an interest in dozens of companies the Oracle of Omaha has researched and evaluated.

Risks with Value Investing

As with any investment strategy, there's the risk of loss with value investing despite it being a low-to-medium-risk strategy. Below we highlight a few of those risks and why losses can occur.

The Figures are Important

Many investors use financial statements when they make value investing decisions. So if you rely on your own analysis, make sure you have the most updated information and that your calculations are accurate. If not, you may end up making a poor investment or miss out on a great one. If you aren’t yet confident in your ability to read and analyze

financial statements

and reports, keep studying these subjects and don’t place any trades until you’re truly ready.

One strategy is to read the footnotes. These are the notes in

Form 10-K

or

Form 10-Q

that explain a company’s financial statements in greater detail. The notes follow the statements and explain the company’s accounting methods and elaborate on reported results. If the footnotes are unintelligible or the information they present seems unreasonable, you’ll have a better idea of whether to pass on the stock.

Extraordinary Gains or Losses

There are some incidents that may show up on a company's income statement that should be considered exceptions or extraordinary. These are generally beyond the company's control and are called

extraordinary item

—gain or

extraordinary item

—loss. Some examples include lawsuits, restructuring, or even a natural disaster. If you exclude these from your analysis, you can probably get a sense of the company's future performance.

However, think critically about these items and use your best judgment. If a company has a pattern of reporting the same extraordinary item year after year, it might not be too extraordinary. Also, if there are unexpected losses year after year, it can be a sign that the company is having financial problems. Extraordinary items are supposed to be unusual and

nonrecurring

. Also, beware of a pattern of

write-offs

.

Ignoring Ratio Analysis Flaws

Earlier sections of this tutorial have discussed calculating various financial ratios that help investors diagnose a company’s financial health. There isn't just one way to determine financial ratios, which can be fairly problematic. The following can affect how the ratios can be interpreted:

Ratios can be determined using before-tax or after-tax numbers.

Some ratios don't give accurate results but lead to estimations.

Depending on how the term earnings are defined, a company's

earnings per share

(EPS) may differ.

Comparing different companies by their ratios—even if the ratios are the same—may be difficult since companies have different accounting practices.

Buying Overvalued Stock

Overpaying for a stock is one of the main risks for value investors. You can risk losing part or all of your money if you overpay. The same goes if you buy a stock close to its

fair market value

. Buying a stock that's undervalued means your risk of losing money is reduced, even when the company doesn't do well.

Recall that one of the fundamental principles of value investing is to build a margin of safety into all your investments. This means purchasing stocks at a price of around two-thirds or less of their

intrinsic value

. Value investors want to risk as little capital as possible in potentially overvalued assets, so they try not to overpay for investments.

Not Diversifying

Conventional investment wisdom says that investing in individual stocks can be a high-risk strategy. Instead, we are taught to invest in multiple stocks or stock indexes so that we have exposure to a wide variety of companies and economic sectors. However, some value investors believe that you can have a diversified portfolio even if you only own a small number of stocks, as long as you choose stocks that represent different industries and different sectors of the economy. Value investor and investment manager Christopher H. Browne recommends owning a minimum of 10 stocks.

According to

Benjamin Graham

, you should look at choosing 10 to 30 stocks if you want to diversify your holdings.

Another set of experts, though, say differently. If you want to get big returns, try choosing just a few stocks, according to the authors of the second edition of “Value Investing for Dummies.” They say having more stocks in your portfolio will probably lead to an average return.

Of course, this advice assumes that you are great at choosing winners, which may not be the case, particularly if you are a value-investing novice.

Listening to Your Emotions

It is difficult to ignore your emotions when making investment decisions. Even if you can take a detached, critical standpoint when evaluating numbers, fear and excitement may creep in when it comes time to actually use part of your hard-earned savings to purchase a stock. More importantly, once you have purchased the stock, you may be tempted to sell it if the price falls.

Keep in mind that the point of value investing is to resist the temptation to panic and go with the herd. So don't fall into the trap of buying when share prices rise and selling when they drop. Such behavior will obliterate your returns (playing follow-the-leader in investing can quickly become a dangerous game).

Example of a Value Investment

Value investors seek to profit from market overreactions that usually come from the release of a quarterly earnings report. As a historical real example, on May 4, 2016, Fitbit released its Q1 2016 earnings report and saw a sharp decline in after-hours trading. After the flurry was over, the company lost nearly 19% of its value. However, while large decreases in a company's share price are not uncommon after the release of an earnings report, Fitbit not only met analyst expectations for the quarter but even increased guidance for 2016.

The company earned $505.4 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2016, up more than 50% when compared to the same time period from one year previous. Further, Fitbit expected to generate between $565 million and $585 million in the second quarter of 2016, which was above the $531 million forecasted by analysts.

The company looked to be strong and growing. However, since Fitbit invested heavily in research and development costs in the first quarter of the year, earnings per share (EPS) declined compared to the previous year. This is all average investors needed to jump, selling off enough shares to cause the price to fall. However, a value investor who looked at the fundamentals of Fitbit understood it was an undervalued security poised to potentially increase in the future.

Case in point—in 2019, Fitbit posted more than $1.4 billion in revenues; then, in 2021, Google finalized its purchase of Fitbit for $2.1 billion.

A value investor purchasing Fitbit stock at an undervalued price of $5.35 on Feb. 9, 2017, would have done well because the stocks were converted to cash at a value of $7.35 per share at the merger and paid to investors.

What Is a Value Investment?

Value investing is an investment philosophy that involves purchasing assets at a discount to their intrinsic value. This is also known as a security’s margin of safety. Benjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, first established this term with his landmark book,

The Intelligent Investor,

in 1949. Notable proponents of value investors include Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, Mohnish Pabrai, and Joel Greenblatt.

What Is an Example of Value Investing?

Common sense and fundamental analysis underlie many of the principles of value investing. The margin of safety, which is the discount a stock trades at compared to its intrinsic value, is one leading principle. Fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, for example, illustrate company earnings in relation to their price. A value investor may invest in a company with a low PE ratio because it provides one barometer for determining whether it is undervalued or overvalued.

What Are Common Value Investing Metrics?

Along with analyzing a company’s price-to-earnings ratio, which can illustrate how expensive it is in relation to its earnings, common metrics include the price-to-book ratio, free cash flow (FCF), and debt-to-equity ratio (D/E).

Who Is Mr. Market?

First coined by Benjamin Graham, “Mr. Market” represents a hypothetical investor that is prone to sharp mood swings of fear, apathy, and euphoria. “Mr. Market” represents the consequences of emotionally reacting to the stock market, rather than rationally or with fundamental analysis. As an archetype for behavior, “Mr. Market” speaks to the price fluctuations inherent in markets, and the emotions that can influence these on extreme scales, such as greed and fear.

The Bottom Line

Value investing is a long-term strategy. Warren Buffett, for example, buys stocks with the intention of holding them almost indefinitely. He once said, “I never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.”

You will probably want to sell your stocks when it comes time to make a major purchase or retire, but by holding a variety of stocks and maintaining a long-term outlook, you can sell your stocks only when their price exceeds their fair market value (and the price you paid for them).

What Is Growth Investing?

Growth investing is an investment style and strategy that is focused on increasing an investor's capital. Growth investors typically invest in

growth stocks

—that is, young or small companies whose

earnings

are expected to increase at an above-average rate compared to their industry sector or the overall market.

Growth investing is highly attractive to many investors because buying stock in emerging companies can provide impressive returns (as long as the companies are successful). However, such companies are untried, and thus often pose a fairly high risk.

Growth investing may be contrasted with

value investing

. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.

key takeaways

Growth investing is a stock-buying strategy that looks for companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to their industry or the broader market.

Growth investors tend to favor smaller, younger companies poised to expand and increase profitability potential in the future.

Growth investors often look to five key factors when evaluating stocks: historical and future earnings growth; profit margins; returns on equity (ROE); and share price performance.

Understanding Growth Investing

Growth investors typically look for investments in rapidly expanding industries (or even entire markets) where new technologies and services are being developed. Growth investors look for profits through capital appreciation—that is, the gains they'll achieve when they sell their stock (as opposed to dividends they receive while they own it). In fact, most growth-stock companies reinvest their earnings back into the business rather than paying a dividend to their shareholders.

These companies tend to be small, young companies with excellent potential. They may also be companies that have just started trading publicly. The idea is that the company will prosper and expand, and this growth in earnings or revenues will eventually translate into higher stock prices in the future. Growth stocks may therefore trade at a high

price/earnings (P/E) ratio

. They may not have earnings at the present moment but are expected to in the future. This is because they may hold patents or have access to technologies that put them ahead of others in their industry. In order to stay ahead of competitors, they reinvest profits to develop even newer technologies, and they seek to secure patents as a way to ensure longer-term growth.

Because investors seek to maximize their

capital gains

, growth investing is also known as a capital growth strategy or a capital appreciation strategy.

Evaluating a Company's Potential for Growth

Growth investors look at a company's or a market's potential for growth. There is no absolute formula for evaluating this potential; it requires a degree of individual interpretation, based on objective and subjective factors, plus personal judgment. Growth investors may use certain methods or criteria as a framework for their analysis, but these methods must be applied with a company's particular situation in mind: Specifically, its current position vis-a-vis its past industry performance and historical financial performance.

In general, though, growth investors look at five key factors when selecting companies that may provide capital appreciation. These include:

Strong Historical Earnings Growth

Companies should show a track record of strong earnings growth over the previous five to 10 years. The minimum

earnings per share

(EPS) growth depends on the size of the company: for example, you might look for growth of at least 5% for companies that are larger than $4 billion, 7% for companies in the $400 million to $4 billion range, and 12% for smaller companies under $400 million. The basic idea is that if the company has displayed good growth in the recent past, it’s likely to continue doing so moving forward.

Strong Forward Earnings Growth

An

earnings announcement

is an official public statement of a company’s profitability for a specific period—typically a quarter or a year. These announcements are made on specific dates during earnings season and are preceded by

earnings estimates

issued by equity analysts. It’s these estimates that growth investors pay close attention to as they try to determine which companies are likely to grow at above-average rates compared to the industry.

Strong Profit Margins

A company’s

pretax profit margin

is calculated by deducting all expenses from sales (except taxes) and dividing by sales. It’s an important metric to consider because a company can have fantastic growth in sales with poor gains in earnings—which could indicate management is not controlling costs and revenues. In general, if a company exceeds its previous five-year average of pretax profit margins—as well as those of its industry—the company may be a good growth candidate.

Strong Return on Equity (ROE)

A company’s

return on equity

(ROE) measures its profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It’s calculated by dividing net income by shareholder equity. A good rule of thumb is to compare a company’s present ROE to the five-year average ROE of the company and the industry. Stable or increasing ROE indicates that management is doing a good job generating returns from shareholders’ investments and operating the business efficiently.

Strong Stock Performance

In general, if a stock cannot realistically double in five years, it’s probably not a growth stock. Keep in mind, a stock’s price would double in seven years with a growth rate of just 10%. To double in five years, the growth rate must be 15%—something that’s certainly feasible for young companies in rapidly expanding industries.

You can find growth stocks trading on any exchange and in any industrial sector—but you’ll usually find them in the fastest-growing industries.

Growth Investing vs. Value Investing

Some consider growth investing and value investing to be diametrically opposed approaches. Value investors seek ""

value stocks

"" that trade below their

intrinsic value

or book value, whereas growth investors—while they do consider a company's fundamental worth—tend to ignore standard indicators that might show the stock to be overvalued.

While value investors look for stocks that are trading for less than their intrinsic value

today

—bargain-hunting so to speak—growth investors focus on the

future

potential of a company, with much less emphasis on the present stock price. Unlike value investors, growth investors may buy stock in companies that are trading higher than their intrinsic value with the assumption that the intrinsic value will grow and ultimately exceed current valuations.

Those interested in learning more about the growth investing, value investing, and other financial topics may want to consider enrolling in one of the

best investing courses

currently available.

Some Growth Investing Gurus

One notable name among growth investors is

Thomas Rowe Price, Jr

., who is known as the father of growth investing. In 1950, Price set up the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, the first mutual fund to be offered by his advisory firm, T. Rowe Price Associates. This flagship fund averaged 15% growth annually for 22 years. Today, T. Rowe Price Group is one of the largest financial services firms in the world.

Philip Fisher

also has a notable name in the growth investing field. He outlined his growth investment style in his 1958 book

Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits,

the first of many he authored. Emphasizing the importance of research, especially through networking, it remains one of the most popular growth investing primers today.

Peter Lynch

, manager of Fidelity Investments' legendary Magellan Fund, pioneered a hybrid model of growth and value investing, which is now commonly referred to as ""growth at a reasonable price"" (GARP) strategy.

Example of a Growth Stock

Amazon Inc. (AMZN) has long been considered a growth stock. In 2021, it remains one of the largest companies in the world and has been for some time. As of Q1 2021, Amazon ranks in the top three U.S. stocks in terms of its

market capitalization

.

Amazon's stock has historically traded at a high price to earnings (P/E) ratio. Between 2019 and early 2020, the stock's P/E has remained upwards of 70, moderating to around 60 in 2021. Despite the company's size,

earnings per share

(EPS) growth estimates for the next five years still hover near 30% per year.

When a company is expected to grow, investors remain willing to invest (even at a high P/E ratio). This is because several years down the road the current stock price may look cheap in hindsight. The risk is that growth doesn't continue as expected. Investors have paid a high price expecting one thing, and not getting it. In such cases, a growth stock's price can fall dramatically.

What Is Tax Planning?

Tax planning is the analysis of a

financial situation or plan

to ensure that all elements work together to allow you to pay the lowest taxes possible. A plan that minimizes how much you pay in taxes is referred to as

tax efficient

. Tax planning should be an essential part of an individual investor's financial plan. Reduction of tax liability and maximizing the ability to contribute to retirement plans are crucial for success.

Key Takeaways

Tax planning is the analysis of a financial situation or plan to ensure that all elements work together to allow you to pay the lowest taxes possible.

Considerations of tax planning include the timing of income, size, the timing of purchases, and planning for expenditures.

Tax planning strategies can include saving for retirement in an IRA or engaging in tax gain-loss harvesting.

Understanding Tax Planning

Tax planning covers several considerations. Considerations include timing of income, size, and timing of purchases, and planning for other expenditures. Also, the selection of investments and types of retirement plans must complement the tax filing status and deductions to create the best possible outcome.

Retirement Saving Strategies

Saving via a retirement plan is a popular way to efficiently reduce taxes. Contributing money to a

traditional IRA

can minimize gross income by the amount contributed. For 2022, if meeting all qualifications, a filer under age 50 can contribute a maximum of $6,000 to their IRA with an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000 if age 50 or older.

That number rises to $6,500 in 2023, with the catch-up contribution holding steady at $1,000.

For example, if a 52-year-old male with an annual income of $50,000 who made a $7,000 contribution to a traditional IRA has an adjusted gross income of $43,000, the $7,000 contribution would grow tax-deferred until retirement.

There are several other retirement plans that an individual may use to help reduce tax liability.

401(k) plans

are popular with larger companies that have many employees. Participants in the plan can defer income from their paycheck directly into the company’s 401(k) plan. The greatest difference is that the contribution limit dollar amount is much higher than that of an IRA.

Using the same example as above, the 52-year-old could contribute up to $27,000 into their 401(k) in 2022 (rising to $30,000 in 2023). That's because in 2022, if a person is under age 50, the salary contribution can be up to $20,500 ($22,500 for 2023), or up to $27,000 ($30,000 for 2022) if age 50 or older due to the allowed additional $6,500 catch-up contribution.

The catch-up contribution for 2023 rises to $7,500.

Tax Planning vs. Tax Gain-Loss Harvesting

Tax gain-loss harvesting

is another form of tax planning or management relating to investments. It is helpful because it can use a portfolio's losses to offset overall capital gains. According to the IRS, short and long-term capital losses must first be used to offset capital gains of the same type. In other words, long-term losses offset long-term gains before offsetting short-term gains. Short-term capital gains, or earnings from assets owned for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income rates.

As of 2022,

long-term capital gains

are taxed as follows:

0% for single filers whose income is no more than $41,675 ($83,350 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $55,800 in the case of an individual who is head of household, or $41,675 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

15% tax for single filers whose income is between $41,676 and $459,750 ($517,200 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $488,500 in the case of an individual who is the head of a household, or $258,600 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

20% tax for those whose income is higher than listed for the 15% tax

In 2023, long-term capital gain limits will be increasing to the following:

0% for single filers whose income is no more than $44,625 ($89,250 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $59,750 in the case of an individual who is head of household, $44,625 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

15% tax for single filers whose income is between $44,626 and $492,300 ($553,850 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $523,050 in the case of an individual who is the head of a household, or $276,900 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)

20% tax for those whose income is higher than that listed for the 15% tax

For example, if a single investor whose income was $100,000 had $10,000 in long-term capital gains, there would be a tax liability of $1,500. If the same investor sold underperforming investments carrying $10,000 in long-term capital losses, the losses would offset the gains, resulting in a tax liability of 0. If the same losing investment were brought back, then a minimum of 30 days would have to pass to avoid incurring a

wash sale

.

According to the Internal Revenue Service, ""If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on (line 21) of Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).

For example, if the 52-year-old investor had $3,000 in net capital losses for the year, the $50,000 income will be adjusted to $47,000. The remaining capital losses can be carried over with no expiration to offset future capital gains.

What is Behavioral Finance?

Behavioral finance

is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It also includes the subsequent effects on the markets. It focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases.

Traditional Financial Theory

In order to better understand behavioral finance, let’s first look at traditional financial theory.

Traditional finance includes the following beliefs:

Both the market and investors are perfectly rational

Investors truly care about utilitarian characteristics

Investors have perfect self-control

They are not confused by cognitive errors or information processing errors

Behavioral Finance Theory

Now let’s compare traditional financial theory with behavioral finance.

Traits of behavioral finance are:

Investors are treated as “normal” not “rational”

They actually have limits to their self-control

Investors are influenced by their own biases

Investors make cognitive errors that can lead to wrong decisions

Decision-Making Errors and Biases

Let’s explore some of the buckets or building blocks that make up behavioral finance.

Behavioral finance views investors as “normal” but being subject to decision-making biases and errors. We can break down the decision-making biases and errors into at least four buckets.

Behavioral Finance Course

!

#1 Self-Deception

The concept of self-deception is a limit to the way we learn. When we mistakenly think we know more than we actually do, we tend to miss information that we need to make an informed decision.

#2 Heuristic Simplification

We can also scope out a bucket that is often called heuristic simplification. Heuristic simplification refers to information-processing errors.

#3 Emotion

Another behavioral finance bucket is related to emotion, but we’re not going to dwell on this bucket in this introductory session. Basically, emotion in behavioral finance refers to our making decisions based on our current emotional state. Our current mood may take our decision-making off track from rational thinking.

#4 Social Influence

What we mean by the social bucket is how our decision-making is influenced by others.

Top 10 Biases in Behavioral Finance

Behavioral finance seeks an understanding of the impact of personal biases on investors. Here is a list of common financial biases.

Common biases include:

Overconfidence and illusion of control

Self Attribution Bias

Hindsight Bias

Confirmation Bias

The Narrative Fallacy

Representative Bias

Framing Bias

Anchoring Bias

Loss Aversion

Herding Mentality

Overcoming Behavioral Finance Issues

There are ways to overcome negative behavioral tendencies in relation to investing. Here are some strategies you can use to guard against biases.

#1 Focus on the Process

There are two approaches to decision-making:

Reflexive

– Going with your gut, which is effortless, automatic and, in fact, is our default option

Reflective

– Logical and methodical, but requires effort to engage in actively

Relying on reflexive decision-making makes us more prone to deceptive biases and emotional and social influences.

Establishing logical decision-making processes can help protect you from such errors.

Get yourself focused on the process rather than the outcome. If you’re advising others, try to encourage the people you’re advising to think about the process rather than just the possible outcomes. Focusing on the process will lead to better decisions because the process helps you engage in reflective decision-making.

#2 Prepare, Plan and Pre-Commit

Behavioral finance teaches us to invest by preparing, by planning, and by making sure we pre-commit. Let’s finish with a quote from Warren Buffett.

“Investing success doesn’t correlate with IQ after you’re above a score of 25. Once you have ordinary intelligence, then what you need is the temperament to control urges that get others into trouble.”

What is Prospect Theory?

Prospect theory is a psychology theory that describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and

uncertainty

. It holds that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains.

Given the choice of equal probabilities, most people would choose to retain the wealth that they already have, rather than risk the chance to increase their current wealth. People are usually averse to the possibility of losing, such that they would rather avoid a loss rather than take a risk to make an equivalent gain.

History of Prospect Theory

The prospect theory is sometimes referred to as the

loss-aversion

theory. The theory was introduced by two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman, and Amos Tversky, to describe how humans make decisions when presented with several choices.

The theory was contained in the paper “

Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk

” that was published in the “Econometrica” journal in 1979. Since it was developed, the prospect theory’s been used in various disciplines. It is used to evaluate various aspects of political decision-making in international relations.

Phases of Prospect Theory

The theory describes the decision-making process in two phases, which include:

1. Editing phase

The editing phase refers to how people involved in decision-making characterize the options for choice or the framing effects. The effects explain how a person’s choice is influenced by the wording, order, or method in which the choices are presented.

An example to demonstrate the framing effect can be the choices that cancer patients are given. Usually, cancer patients are presented with the choice of undergoing surgery or chemotherapy to treat their illnesses, and they make a decision based on whether the outcome statistics are presented in terms of survival rates or mortality rates. Once the choices have been framed ready for decision-making, the theory enters the second phase.

2. Evaluation phase

In the evaluation phase, people tend to behave as if they would make a decision based on the potential outcomes and choose the option with a higher utility. The phase uses

statistical analysis

to measure and compare the outcomes of each prospect. The evaluation phase comprises two indices, i.e., the value function and the weighting function, which are used to compare the prospects.

Features of the Prospect Theory

The prospects theory comes with the following characteristics:

1. Certainty

When presented with several options to choose from, humans show a strong preference for the option with certainty. They are willing to sacrifice the option that offers more potential income in order to achieve more certainty. For example, assume that a lottery provides two options, A and B.

Option A provides a guaranteed win of $100 while option B provides the possibility of winning $200, with a 70% chance of winning and 30% chance of losing. Most people will choose option A since it provides a guaranteed win, even though it offers a lower return compared to B.

2. Small probabilities

People tend to discount very small probabilities even if there is a possibility of losing all their wealth. By discounting the small probabilities, people end up choosing higher-risk options with higher probabilities.

3. Relative positioning

Relative positioning means that people tend to focus less on their final income or wealth, and more on the relative gains or losses that they will get. If their relative position does not improve with increases in income, they will not feel better off. This means that people tend to compare themselves to their neighbors, friends, and family members, and are less interested in whether they are better off than they were some years back.

For example, if everybody in the office gets a 20% raise, no individual will feel better off. However, if the person gets a 10% raise, and other people fail to get a raise, that person will feel better off and richer than everyone else.

4. Loss aversion

People tend to give more weight to losses rather than gains made by taking a certain option. For example, if a person makes $200 in profits and $100 in losses, the person will focus on the loss even though they emerged with a $100 net gain. This shows that people are more concerned about losses rather than gains.

Criticism of Prospect Theory

One of the criticisms of the prospects theory is that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about. The criticism comes from other psychologists who notes that factors such as human emotional and affective responses that are important in the decision-making process are absent in the model.

The theory is also criticized for the inadequate framing theory that explains why actors generate the frames they use. Decision-makers often need to deal with competing frames across various issues.

What Is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act?

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress in response to financial industry behavior that led to the

financial crisis of 2007–2008

. It sought to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers.

Named for sponsors Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the act contains numerous provisions, spelled out over 848 pages, that were to be implemented over a period of several years.

Key Takeaways

The Dodd-Frank Act targeted financial system sectors that were believed to have caused the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

Leading up to 2007, lax regulations led to extremely risky lending practices, which caused a housing sector bubble that ultimately burst and drove the global crisis, the need for public bailouts of financial institutions, and the recession.

The institutions considered responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis included banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies.

Critics of the law argue that the regulatory burdens it imposes could make U.S. firms less competitive than their foreign counterparts.

In 2018, Congress passed a new law that rolled back some of Dodd-Frank’s restrictions.

Understanding the Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a massive piece of

financial reform legislation

that was passed in 2010, during the Obama administration.

Commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, or Dodd-Frank, it established a number of new government agencies tasked with overseeing the various components of the law and, by extension, various aspects of the

financial system

.

The 2007–2008 financial crisis is perhaps the worst economic catastrophe to befall the country (and the world) since the Wall Street crash in 1929. Broadly speaking, it was caused by greed-driven behavior and lax oversight of financial institutions.

The loosening of financial industry regulations in the decades leading up to 2007 allowed various types of institutions in the U.S. financial services industry to lend money in ways that were riskier than ever before. The housing sector in particular experienced massive growth that couldn't be supported.

The bubble burst, sending the banking industry and global stock markets into a downfall. It created the worst global recession in generations.

Dodd-Frank was created to keep anything similar from ever happening again.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2007–2008.

Components of the Dodd-Frank Act

Here are some of the law’s key provisions and how they work:

Financial Stability:

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the

Financial Stability Oversight Council

and the Orderly Liquidation Authority monitor the financial stability of major financial firms. The failure of these companies (deemed

too big to fail

) could have a serious negative impact on the U.S. economy. The law also provides for liquidations or restructurings via the Orderly Liquidation Fund. This fund was established to assist with the dismantling of financial companies that have been placed in receivership to prevent tax dollars from being used to prop up such firms. The council has the authority to break up banks that are considered so large as to pose

systemic risk

. It can also force banks to increase their reserve requirements. Similarly, the new

Federal Insurance Office

was tasked with identifying and monitoring insurance companies that were also considered too big to fail.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:

The

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

, established under Dodd-Frank, was given the job of preventing predatory mortgage lending and helping consumers understand the terms of a mortgage before agreeing to it. This reflected the widespread sentiment that the

subprime mortgage

market was the underlying cause of the 2007–2008 catastrophe. The CFPB deters mortgage brokers from earning higher commissions for closing loans with higher fees and/or higher interest rates. It requires that

mortgage originators

not steer potential borrowers to the loan that will result in the highest payment for the originator. The CFPB also governs other types of consumer lending, including credit and debit cards, and addresses consumer complaints. It requires lenders, excluding automobile lenders, to disclose information in a form that is easy for consumers to read and understand. Such an example is the simplified terms now on credit card applications.

Volcker Rule:

The

Volcker Rule

restricts how banks can invest, limits speculative trading, and eliminates

proprietary trading

. Banks are not allowed to be involved with hedge funds or private equity firms, which are considered too risky. To minimize possible conflicts of interest, financial firms are not allowed to trade proprietarily without sufficient ""skin in the game.” The Volcker Rule is clearly a pushback in the direction of the

Glass-Steagall Act

of 1933, which first recognized the inherent dangers of financial entities extending commercial and investment banking services at the same time. The act also contains a provision for regulating

derivatives

, such as the

credit default swaps

that were widely blamed for contributing to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Dodd-Frank set up centralized exchanges for swaps trading to reduce the possibility of counterparty default. It required greater disclosure of swaps trading information to increase transparency in those markets. The Volcker Rule also regulates financial firms’ use of derivatives in an attempt to prevent “too big to fail” institutions from taking large risks that might wreak havoc on the broader economy.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Office of Credit Ratings:

Dodd-Frank established the SEC Office of Credit Ratings because

credit rating

agencies had been accused of giving out misleading favorable investment ratings in the lead-up to the financial crisis. The office is charged with ensuring that agencies provide meaningful and reliable credit ratings of the businesses, municipalities, and other entities that they evaluate.

Whistleblower Program:

Dodd-Frank also strengthened and expanded the existing whistleblower program promulgated by the

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)

of 2002. Specifically, it established a mandatory bounty program under which

whistleblowers

can receive from 10% to 30% of the proceeds from a litigation settlement, broadened the scope of a covered employee by including employees of a company’s subsidiaries and affiliates, and extended the statute of limitations under which whistleblowers can bring forward a claim against their employer from 90 to 180 days after a violation is discovered.

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act

When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, he pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank. Siding with critics, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which rolled back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

It was signed into law by then-President Trump on May 24, 2018.

These are some of the provisions of that law, and some of the areas in which previous standards were loosened:

The new law eased the Dodd-Frank regulations for small and regional banks by increasing the asset threshold for the application of prudential standards,

stress test

requirements, and mandatory risk committees.

For institutions that have custody of clients’ assets but do not function as lenders or traditional bankers, the new law provided for lower

capital requirements

and leverage ratios.

The new law exempted escrow requirements for residential mortgage loans held by a depository institution or credit union under certain conditions. It also directed the

Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)

to set up standards for

Freddie Mac

and

Fannie Mae

to consider alternative credit scoring methods.

The law exempted lenders with assets of less than $10 billion from requirements of the Volcker Rule and imposed less stringent reporting and capital norms on small lenders.

The law required that the three major credit reporting agencies allow consumers to

freeze

their credit files free of charge as a way of deterring fraud.

After Joseph Biden was elected president in 2020, the CFPB focused on rescinding rules from the Trump era that were in direct conflict with the charter of the CFPB.

The Biden administration has also announced its intent to reestablish rules against other forms of predatory lending, such as

payday loans

, and on June 30, 2023, Bided signed a law to overturn the OCC's payday lending regulations.

Additionally,

subprime auto loan

practices are being addressed by the CFPB.

Criticism of the Dodd-Frank Act

Proponents of Dodd-Frank believed that the law would prevent the economy from experiencing a crisis like that of 2007–2008 and protect consumers from many of the abuses that contributed to the crisis.

Detractors, however, have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, they contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions, despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis.

Such financial world notables as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Blackstone Group L.P. (

BX

) CEO Stephen Schwarzman, activist Carl Icahn, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (

JPM

) CEO Jamie Dimon also argued that, while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints make for a more

illiquid

market overall.

The lack of liquidity can be especially potent in the bond market, where all securities are not

marked to market

and many bonds lack a constant supply of buyers and sellers. The higher

reserve

requirements under Dodd-Frank mean that banks must keep a higher percentage of their assets in cash. This decreases the amount that they are able to hold in marketable securities.

In effect, this limits the bond market-making role that banks have traditionally undertaken. With banks unable to play the part of a

What Was the Purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act?

Dodd-Frank is intended to curb the extremely risky financial industry activities that led to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Its goal was, and still is, to protect consumers and taxpayers from egregious practices like predatory lending.

Is the Dodd-Frank Act Still in Effect?

Yes, it is; however, its regulatory strength was diluted with the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. Still, certain aspects, such as the bank stress tests it called for, are in use today. The Federal Reserve publishes stress test results regularly.

What Are Some Criticisms of the Dodd-Frank Act?

Detractors of the Dodd-Frank Act have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, critics contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions—despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis. Several financial world notables have also argued that, while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints also make for a more illiquid market overall.

What Was the Impact of the 2018 Rollback of Dodd-Frank Regulations?

In 2018, the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act rolled back numerous regulations put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Dodd-Frank rules, banks with $50 billion in assets were subject to more strenuous capital and liquidity requirements, but the new law in 2018 increased the asset threshold to $250 billion. This change relaxed the regulations for smaller and medium-sized banks. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March 2023, observers argued that the lack of regulatory scrutiny on financial institutions of this size played a key role in the bank's failure.

The Bottom Line

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, was a direct response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing government bailouts under the

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)

.

This law established a wide range of reforms throughout the entire financial system, with the purpose of preventing a repeat of the 2007–2008 crisis and the need for further government bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act also included additional protections for consumers.

Although the Trump administration reversed and weakened several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly those affecting consumers, the Biden administration intends to reestablish and strengthen the previous reversals to protect individuals who may be subject to predatory lending practices in industries like for-profit education and automobiles.

Regulation and policy

Solvency II

Solvency II

Page contents

What is Solvency II?

Solvency II is the prudential regime for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the EU.

It has entered into force in January 2016.

Solvency II sets out requirements applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies in the EU with the aim to ensure the

adequate protection of policyholders and beneficiaries.

Solvency II has a

risk-based approach

that enables to assess the “overall solvency” of insurance and reinsurance undertakings through quantitative and qualitative measures.

How is the Solvency II regulatory framework structured?

The Solvency II regulatory framework is built on a three-pillar structure:

Pillar I

sets the quantitative requirements i.e. the assets and liabilities valuation and capital requirements.

Pillar II

sets the qualitative requirements, including governance and risk management of the undertakings and the Own Risk and solvency Assessment (ORSA).

Pillar III

sets the supervisory reporting and public disclosure.

The three pillars form a coherent approach that allow to understand and to manage risks across the sector.

What are its main features?

The key features of the Solvency II regulatory framework are:

Market consistent

: assets and liabilities shall be valued at the amount for which they can be exchanged, transferred or settled in the market

Risk-based

:  Higher risks will lead to a higher capital requirement to cover for unexpected losses

Proportionate

: regulatory requirements shall be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to the business of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

Group supervision

: supervisors shall increase coordination and exchange of information in colleges of supervisors to improve cross-border supervision of insurance and reinsurance groups

Solvency II legal provisions

The Solvency II legislation is implemented on three levels.

To get a full view on the legal provisions, visit the Solvency II Single Rulebook, which provides a direct access to key regulatory and supervisory texts within the scope of EIOPA’s activity.

GO TO THE RULEBOOK

Level 1: Solvency II Directive

The

Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)

lays down the general principles.

Level 2: the Delegated Regulation and Implementing technical standards

The

Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II)

is a directly applicable legislative act which does not require any additional implementation.

Implementing technical standards are legislative provisions made by the European Commission on the basis of advice received from EIOPA. The implementing technical standards are accessible via the rulebook.

Level 3: Guidelines

EIOPA issues guidelines and recommendations to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices and to ensure common and consistent application of Union law. National supervisory authorities are required to incorporate them following a “comply or explain” process.

See the guidelines

Other documents

Questions and Answers

Any natural or legal person, including financial institutions, competent authorities and Union institutions and bodies can submit questions relating to the practical application or implementation of the provisions of legislative acts, associated delegated and implementing acts and EIOPA’s guidelines and recommendations in the field of insurance and pensions within EIOPA’s competence. Q&A aim at ensure consistent application of European regulation in all member states as well.

2020 Solvency II review

EIOPA provided its technical advice to the European Commission on 17 December 2020.

Background: how and why Solvency II came to life?

Three generations of EU Directives applicable since the 1970s paved the way for an insurance market to operate on the basis of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services within the European Union.  Over time, the regulatory framework seemed increasingly ill-suited to supervise the industry.

Due to its simplicity, lack of an economic risk-based approach and differences in implementation across the European Union, the existing regulation needed revision.

In 1999, the European Commission presented its paper on ""The Review of the Overall Financial Position of an Insurance Undertaking"". This initiated the discussion among the European institutions, regulators and supervisors on the modernisation of the prudential framework for the supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

The discussions took particular importance in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Although the majority of troubled institutions were banks, several insurers were also affected by the crisis, attributable to inappropriate investment decisions by insurers which led to significant losses, the interconnectedness with banks or, in general, evidence of poor governance, a report issued by EIOPA in July 2018 stated. The crisis showed the importance of a harmonised understanding of the risks by all involved actors, and the need for considering wider implications for financial stability.

It crystallised the need for bringing the regulatory framework at the forefront of modern risk management, reflecting the reality of large groups operating on a cross-border basis. The crisis also showed that the EU was not sufficiently equipped to ensure effective cooperation and coordination between national financial supervisory bodies as well as a consistent application of the legal framework across all Member States.

In 2009, a report was issued by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU, chaired by Jacques de Larosière, echoeing the weaknesses in the supervisory and regulatory regime that contributed to the financial crisis.

The Solvency II Directive (Directive 2009/138/EC [recast]) was adopted in November 2009, and amended by Directive 2014/51/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 (the so-called “Omnibus II Directive"").

On 10 October 2014, the European Commission (EC) adopted the Delegated Regulation (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35) containing implementing rules for Solvency II. The Delegated Regulation was published in the Official Journal on 17 January 2015.

On 20 September 2015, the EC adopted the Delegated Regulation 2016/467 amending Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 concerning the calculation of regulatory capital requirements for several categories of assets held by insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

The first set of Solvency II Implementing Regulations laying down implementing technical standards with regard to the supervisory approval procedures for undertaking-specific parameters, ancillary own funds, matching adjustment, special purpose vehicles, internal models, and joint decision on group internal models was adopted in March 2015. The second set of Implementing Regulations was adopted later in 2015.

Corporate governance

Corporate governance

Directors and company officers play an essential role in establishing and maintaining the standard of a company's corporate governance.

Corporate governance is a driver of the operations and performance of a company. The term 'corporate governance' is broad and has many components including relationships between stakeholders, frameworks, decision making and responsibility.

ASIC guidance

ASIC provides guidance to assist individuals and responsible entities to comply with their obligations, make good decisions and act in the best interests of investors.

We regularly engage with stakeholders on corporate governance-related issues through articles in external publications, speeches at events and the publications of reports, regulatory guides and information sheets.

The following articles, speeches and other publications detail ASIC’s viewpoint on aspects of corporate governance.

Corporate Governance Taskforce

Managing conflicts

Shareholder engagement

Director oversight of financials and audit

Emerging risk management

Executive remuneration

Directors and corporate culture

Corporate actions involving share capital

Directors as gatekeepers

(including the

ASX Corporate Governance Council

)

Australian Institute of Company Directors

Governance Institute of Australia

Financial Services Council

Australian Council of Superannuation Investors.

Guidance on matters of corporate governance – particularly directors' duties – can be found in the judgements of various Australian courts.

Blockchain vs. Crypto: Not What It Seems

“Blockchain not bitcoin” emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market’s performance woes – the new version does the same but swaps in “crypto” to reflect the ecosystem’s spread.

Déjà vu. You know that feeling, when you momentarily are not sure of where you are in the timeline and you wonder what you’ve missed. We’re there now.

The “blockchain not bitcoin” chorus seems to be re-emerging, taking us back to the 2016-18 heyday of thematic and platform consortia convinced that the benefits of greater efficiency would overcome corporate competition. Bitcoin was an asset with no backing or clear utility, the implied argument seemed to go, whereas blockchain, well that was a technology.

Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her

Crypto Is Macro Now

newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.

Last week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled “

Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto

,” in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Last month, Citi

published the results

of a survey showing that 92% of participating institutions see value in tokenization while 88% are either exploring distributed ledger use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. Over the past few days, the Red Cross

talked about

ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype, and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group

announced plans to

work on

soulbound tokens

for digital identity.

What’s going on? Is this part of a post-FTX “reset,” a cathartic back-to-basics? Or is something else in play?

Both. Yes, we are likely to see more public discussion about distributed ledger efficiencies and less about crypto asset trading and investment. This is a natural reflex after the damage done by layered leverage, flimsy tokenomics and trading fraud, and some high-profile reminders that crypto is not just about greed are more than welcome.

BTC Dominance Is Behaving Weirdly, and That’s Sort of Good

| Opinion

It is also an acknowledgement that there is a constant battle for attention, and the “X not Y” model assumes that only one variable is worthy. “Blockchain not bitcoin” emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market’s performance woes – the new version does the same but swaps in “crypto” to reflect the ecosystem’s spread.

So, a large part of this is a cyclical narrative shift. But there’s something else going on as well. This shift comes on top of a longer-term tale of technological evolution and shiny things.

The last wave of blockchain hype may not seem to have produced much value. Pilots and proofs of concept involving

lettuce

,

plastics

, even (alarmingly)

nuclear weapons

seemed to deliver no practical utility. Groups working on blockchain use cases for trade finance, healthcare, telecoms, insurance and more have either gone quiet or been wound down.

And we have seen some recent high-profile distributed ledger failures. A couple of weeks ago, IBM and Maersk

announced the closure

of their blockchain-based supply chain joint venture TradeLens. Last month, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX)

canceled its much-hyped blockchain project

after years of delays and cost overruns. This summer blockchain-based trade finance initiative

we.trade

, backed by IBM and 12 major European banks,

went into liquidation

and B3i – a blockchain insurance venture backed by more than 20 insurers and reinsurers –

ceased operation

.

So, the “please, not again” discomfort at the renewed protagonism of “blockchain” potential is understandable and even healthy (inflated expectations of any sort should be kept in check) – but not necessarily correct.

Both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology’s evolution. Remember the dot-com bubble? That wasn’t just about crazy stock valuations – it was as much about the promise of rapid societal change, with business models rewiring their engagement models and individuals flourishing in their new-found creative independence. In the early days of any radical innovation, manifesto and prophecy often get confused, and experimentation – of which failure is an integral part – is the only way to test the bounds of reality.

Central Banks and Bitcoin: Closer Than You Think

| Opinion

You’re probably wondering where the successes are, and that’s fair because they don’t get much attention. They’re hidden in the persistence of some projects that could have given up ages ago, in new use cases under trial, and in a changing participant profile. Distributed ledger work has been ongoing all along, but given the rapid growth of crypto markets, the “flashiness” of some participants and the gripping drama of the year so far, it has been largely overlooked. Things that move fast get more attention. Enterprise experimentation does not move fast.

Some examples: A few years ago, we got excited when a

commercial bank

successfully issued

blockchain-based assets in pilot tests. This week a state-owned bank

did the same

but for real, and at least one government is

almost there

, while other

governments

and

banks

are testing

the process with some intriguing innovations. We also have trials where the main participants are

central banks

. That is definitely progress.

Large traditional asset managers such as

KKR

,

Apollo

and

Hamilton Lane

are issuing blockchain-based tokens representing funds. Not as a proof-of-concept but for real. Just this week we learned that Vanguard Australia

is using a distributed ledger

for back-office settlement, Starbucks (one of the

largest unregulated

“banks” in the world) has

launched a non-fungible token (NFT) experience

in beta for its Rewards users, and

Goldman Sachs

as well as

Germany’s music rights management society

have carried out separate distributed ledger tests. Recent initiatives seem to have learned from the failures to date: start small, iterate up the ladder and never overlook human incentives.

​There’s also an ideological battle afoot. Many in the crypto industry hate the idea of anything being “permissioned” and accuse all gated experimentation of being “useless” while overlooking regulatory restrictions and client preferences. The assumption seems to be that everyone prefers open networks, permissioned blockchains can never be based on public ones and that the potential to integrate with stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) is irrelevant.

After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto’s Founding Mission

| Opinion

There’s also a strong cohort who thinks we should focus on more innovative applications since traditional markets work fine, in spite of settlement risk, gated access and a dangerous lack of transparency. More efficient and lower cost debt markets, for example, open up opportunities for a much broader demographic than big banks, possibly facilitating the development of sophisticated markets in regions currently underserved. They also make new types of products possible, such as intraday repo, enhancing liquidity in tight markets. Could this be done on traditional databases? Some of it, sure, but would that be future-proofing market evolution? Determining the answer to that is precisely what the experimentation is for.

As the dust settles on the FTX fallout, and as the crypto ecosystem takes stock of the damage and starts to heal, we can expect more prominence for enterprise blockchain milestones. This doesn’t at all mean that crypto is losing its sparkle or that asset innovation is done. Last week we saw the emergence of an

intriguing new derivative

that lets traders bet on the Ethereum staking yield, potentially coalescing market acceptance of a benchmark interest rate. We are also still seeing glimmers of

institutional interest

in crypto assets

as investment

. None of that will disappear.

But a time in the sun for the less-glamorous side of blockchain evolution will be good for the industry as a whole. We could well still see some ideas that strike us as fanciful, because people are people and creativity should never cease to surprise – who knows, some might even stick. But we can certainly expect more solid experimentation at senior levels.

Perhaps even more important: we have to push back on the “X not Y” mentality. The crypto ecosystem is certainly big enough by now for any number of approaches, and this industry grew on the back of permissionless innovation – it’s incongruous to see crypto enthusiasts argue that only one approach is worth any time or attention. For those who care about distributed ledger utility, there’s plenty to get excited about. For those who think there’s greater societal value in trading and saving, markets will continue to evolve and some prices will eventually recover. Many of us may be frustrated by the amount of pixels given to what we personally see as useless ideas – but we should think about what our industry would look like were one reduced group to have the power to decide what is “valid” and what isn’t.

Meanwhile, the narrative shift will act as a refreshing reminder that this industry is about much more than profits and portfolio allocations, and that the potential goes way beyond sentiment recovery, regulatory clarity and deeper understanding. “Blockchain and crypto” – there’s plenty of room for both.

What Is Cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.

A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

Key Takeaways

A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.

Some experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law.

The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure.

The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities.

Investopedia / Tara Anand

Understanding Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. ""Crypto"" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.

Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network.

Every new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger.

Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (

JPM

) are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.

Types of Cryptocurrency

Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example,

Ethereum's

ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism.

Ripple's

XRP is designed to be used by banks to facilitate transfers between different geographies.

Because there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market,

it's important to understand

the types of cryptocurrencies. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide

whether it is worth investing in

—a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use.

Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category:

Utility

: XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains.

Transactional

: Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.

Governance

: These tokens represent voting or other rights on a blockchain, such as Uniswap.

Platform

: These tokens support applications built to use a blockchain, such as Solana.

Security tokens

: Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millenium Sapphire.

If you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure it's legitimate.

Are Cryptocurrencies Legal?

Fiat currencies

derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, each dollar bill is backstopped by the U. S. government.

But cryptocurrencies are not backed by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their

legal status in different financial jurisdictions

throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure.

In the U.S.

The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the

Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.

Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets—either as capital gains or ordinary income—depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it.

In the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges.

Enthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry.

El Salvador

is the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions as of August 2023.

In the rest of the world,

cryptocurrency regulation varies

by jurisdiction.

In Asia

Japan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer.

China has

banned cryptocurrency exchanges

, transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)

.

India was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies.

In Europe

Cryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as ""financial instruments."" In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies.

Are Cryptocurrencies Safe Investments?

Cryptocurrencies have attracted a

reputation as unstable investments

due to high investor losses due to scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure,

the technical complexity

of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users.

In addition to the

market risks

associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks:

User risk

: Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. By some estimates, about one-fifth of all bitcoins are now inaccessible due to lost passwords or incorrect sending addresses.

Regulatory risks

: The regulatory status of some cryptocurrencies is still unclear, with many governments seeking to regulate them as securities, currencies, or both. A sudden regulatory crackdown could make it challenging to sell cryptocurrencies or cause a market-wide price drop.

Counterparty risks

:

Many investors and merchants rely on exchanges or other custodians to store their cryptocurrency. Theft or loss by one of these third parties could result in losing one's entire investment.

Management risks

: Due to the lack of coherent regulations, there are few protections against deceptive or unethical management practices. Many investors have lost large sums to management teams that failed to deliver a product.

Programming risks

:

Many investment and lending platforms use automated smart contracts to control the movement of user deposits. An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment.

Market Manipulation

:

Market manipulation remains a substantial problem in cryptocurrency, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges acting unethically.

Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about $1.2 trillion.

Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation.

Advantages

Removes single points of failure

Easier to transfer funds between parties

Removes third parties

Can be used to generate returns

Remittances are streamlined

Disadvantages

Transactions are pseudonymous

Pseudonymity allows for criminal uses

Have become highly centralized

Expensive to participate in a network and earn

Off-chain security issues

Prices are very volatile

Advantages Explained

Cryptocurrencies represent

a new, decentralized paradigm for money

. In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure—such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S.

Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized

transfers

are secured by the use of

public keys

and

private keys

and different forms of incentive systems, such as

proof of work

or

proof of stake

.

Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in

decentralized finance

are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without backing collateral, can be executed within seconds and are used in trading.

Cryptocurrency investments can generate profits. Cryptocurrency markets have skyrocketed in value over the past decade, reaching almost $2 trillion. Bitcoin was valued at more than $680 billion in crypto markets as of November 2023.

The

remittance

economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin

serve as intermediate currencies

to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement.

Disadvantages Explained

Though they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions.

Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of

Dread Pirate Roberts

, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known.

Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.

In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. In reality, ownership is highly concentrated. Just 100 addresses hold roughly 15% of circulating bitcoin and total value.

One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies require considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars.

Only 98 (2%) of the 4,882 Bitcoin blocks opened from Dec. 29, 2022 to Jan. 29, 2023 were opened by unknown addresses. The other 98% were opened by mining pools.

Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins.

Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments

require accurate price monitoring

. For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later.

As a result, many people consider cryptocurrencies to be a short-lived fad or

speculative bubble

.

How Do You Buy Cryptocurrencies?

You can purchase cryptocurrency from popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, apps such as Cash App, or through brokers. Another popular way to

invest in cryptocurrencies

is through financial derivatives, such as CME's Bitcoin futures, or other instruments, such as Bitcoin trusts and ETFs.

What Is the Point of Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies are a new paradigm for money. They promise to streamline existing financial architecture to make it faster and cheaper. In addition, their technology and architecture decentralize existing monetary systems and make it possible for transacting parties to exchange value and money independently of intermediary institutions such as banks.

What Are the Most Popular Cryptocurrencies?

Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, followed by

other cryptocurrencies

such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, Solana, and Cardano.

The Bottom Line

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to

understand the risks involved

before investing.

Blockchain is a

decentralized record-keeping technology

that stores data unalterably on a public ledger. The fact that it is decentralized, censorship-proof, immutable, and tamper-proof makes blockchain a completely secure technology. In a blockchain network, a type of

distributed ledger technology (DLT)

, every node works to prevent errors and verify transactions.

While blockchain can be thought of as a database, it has many aspects that distinguish it from traditional databases. While traditional databases store data in tables, rows, columns and files, blockchain uses blocks that are chained together to store data. Databases are usually hosted on a central server, making those with access to the server able to manipulate data and change records. Because blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, it is not possible to change data on the network. The first and most famous thing to represent the use of blockchain is

Bitcoin

.

Explaining blockchain for beginners:

Blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that enables users to transact without any centralized authority. The consensus about the state of balances and transactions among network validators is reached via a consensus mechanism, with

Proof-of-Work

(used by Bitcoin) and

Proof-of-Stake

(used by Ethereum) being the most popular ones.

Contrary to popular belief, blockchain technology is not just related to cryptocurrencies. Judiciary, banks, logistics companies, the entertainment industry, and many other sectors are putting ever more emphasis on blockchain solutions. Smart contract capabilities, tokenization, and immutability are major benefits that blockchain technology offers to companies. Essentially, blockchain technology is capable of facilitating a low-cost and secure way of keeping digital data records.

What is blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology, one of the best use cases of distributed ledger technology, is essentially a decentralized data-storing digital ledger. When anyone wishes to make a transaction on the blockchain network, an entry in a blockchain block representing that transaction is created. The resulting block is sent to the node operators in the network. Node operators are computers that operate independently of each other around the world.

Blockchain networks have certain algorithms to validate transactions and achieve consensus. The most commonly used algorithms are

Proof-of-Work

(PoW) and

Proof-of-Stake

(PoS). They differ in their approaches to transaction validation and new block production. The best example of PoW is

Bitcoin

, while the largest PoS network is

Ethereum

.

PoW networks like Bitcoin rely on powerful computer hardware for transaction validation and new block production.

Computers

mining on the Bitcoin network

compete with each other to create blocks, using their computing power and energy to validate new transactions on the network. In this energy-intensive process, computers that validate transactions by solving complex mathematical problems receive BTC rewards in return. The transaction of the person who wants to transact on the blockchain network is validated, the person pays a transaction fee, and the miner who validates the transaction wins a BTC reward.

When Will the Last Bitcoin Be Mined?

Each block in the blockchain is created by connecting to the previous block. The transaction in each block is verified with an alphanumeric timestamp called a hash, and a consensus is reached on the block. The block added afterward cannot change the data in the previous block at all, it can only reference the data. In addition, each new block features a hash of a previous block in the chain, making it impossible to rearrange blocks in any way – this prevents any sort of data tampering, making data stored on the blockchain completely secure.

How does blockchain technology work?

The entire operation of blockchain technology can be broken down into five crucial steps:

A transaction is made and authenticated by the underlying blockchain technology.

The transaction (or a collection of transactions) sparks the creation of a new blockchain block.

The new block is sent to every network node.

Network validators review the transaction data and add the block to the blockchain once the data is verified. The task is rewarded with mining rewards in PoW networks, and with staking rewards in PoS networks.

The updated blockchain that includes the new block and all previous blocks is distributed across the network.

Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are the

most common digital assets using blockchain technology

. Bitcoin was put forward as a project by a pseudonymous individual creator or group named

Satoshi Nakamoto

in 2008. Bitcoin network and the first block were launched in 2009.

Litecoin

, created by Charlie Lee in 2011, is the second cryptocurrency created using open-source codes, directly following in Bitcoin’s footsteps.

The history of blockchain technology

Blockchain was first introduced by cryptographer and computer scientist

David Chaum

in a thesis written in 1982 as a proposal to ""design a distributed computer system that can be established, maintained and trusted by mutual groups"". In 1991, W

. Scott Stornetta

and

Stuart Haber

came up with the idea of ​​securing it with cryptography to improve the definition of blockchain. Although many people worked on digital currencies that would work with blockchain technology during and after the same dates, none of them were fully implemented.

Published in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper, kickstarted the cryptocurrency revolution.

As we mentioned above, in 2008, the initial idea for the Bitcoin blockchain was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in a whitepaper called ""

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

"". Blockchain technology first started increasing in popularity with the launch of

Litecoin

,

Ripple

, and

Dogecoin

. Bitcoin reached a new high in market cap and price in December 2013. The idea for

Ethereum

was introduced by

Vitalik Buterin

in July 2014 and was launched in July 2015.

Top 10 facts about Vitalik Buterin

With Ethereum, the concept of smart contracts came to blockchain technology, and in December 2017, cryptocurrencies reached a new peak. In the years that followed, adoption increased as the appetite for

DeFi technology

increased, and by 2022 the majority of new fintech startups are now using blockchain technology.

Usecase examples of blockchain technology

Blockchain technology continues to attract the attention of more industries and companies over the years. As more companies adopt blockchain technology, the technology evolves more and more useful use cases are provided.

The

peer-to-peer exchange

feature of the blockchain provides great convenience in transforming traditional tickets into secure interactive digital assets.

NFT technology

, which we will talk about later in this write-up, allows any asset to be transformed into an original digital asset.

Many stores and e-commerce sites accept cryptocurrencies and

crypto cards

as a form of payment.

NFT, a relatively new technology enabled by the blockchain, has begun to be used, particularly by industries such as music and the arts, to

verify ownership of digital content

and protect copyrights.

Many raffles, lottery, giveaway, draw, and sweepstake platforms have started using

open-source randomization blockchain projects

and oracles to prove that events are fair.

There are many governments and companies embracing the use of blockchain and

IoT technologies

for digital assets, personal health information, property deeds, prescription records, supply chain records, and more.

Supply chains starting from product manufacturing can be tracked using real-time unchangeable data. The conditions at the production stage, storage stage, transportation stage, and sale stage of a product can be seen transparently.

Blockchain, meaning technology that enables P2P transactions without intermediaries, will likely play an ever larger role as social interactions and finance continue shifting online.

Consensus mechanisms

Different blockchain networks adopt different consensus mechanisms and use those algorithms. A decentralized consensus must be relied on for an error-free coded algorithm.

Consensus mechanism

, a procedure in which everyone on the blockchain will agree on the current and future state of the distributed ledger, is a system in which everyone has voting rights as much as the power they provide to the network.

The two most commonly preferred consensus mechanisms are Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, followed by

Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

and

Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)

algorithms.

Proof-of-Work

is a consensus mechanism that used to be common but is no longer often preferred. This mechanism, which is currently used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV, is an algorithm that requires computing power and energy-intensive use.

Proof-of-Stake

is an algorithm developed as an alternative to PoW. The system, which uses staking native coins on the blockchain instead of using powerful mining equipment to validate transactions on the network, is a much more environmentally friendly and faster system than PoW.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance

is a consensus mechanism developed to work in asynchronous systems.

Delegated Proof of Stake

is a mechanism developed in blockchain to counter the centralization and exploitation of the network. In this mechanism, delegates are selected for bidding and voting.

Every technology has its advantages and disadvantages – blockchain is no exception.

Pros of blockchain technology

Blockchain technology provides users with an increasing number of benefits every day. A significant part of these benefits is based on decentralization, immutability, and security.

Records in blocks validated on the blockchain cannot be changed or deleted. This means that the data cannot be tampered with.

Thanks to constantly developed algorithms, blockchains reach a speed that can process up to 750,000 transactions per second.

Hacking blockchains is quite difficult as it is a technology protected by hundreds of thousands or even millions of computers worldwide.

All nodes keep a copy of the blockchain ledger. If one node crashes, the other nodes continue to work, and transactions on the network are not interrupted.

The peer-to-peer feature eliminates the need for third parties and middlemen. In this way, transactions are processed faster, and no commission is paid to anyone.

Blockchains are completely transparent as they are a public distributed ledger technology. In other words, transactions made by any wallet address on the blockchain can be seen by anyone.

Wallets are anonymous. While we can see the transactions made by a blockchain wallet, we have no way of knowing the owner of the wallet.

Blockchain is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, unlike banks and other financial institutions.

Cons of blockchain technology

Since blockchain technology is still a technology in development, it has several problems and risks that need to be resolved. Some of these problems are:

Too many transactions on the network can increase storage requirements too much, causing the network to slow down and increase transaction costs. Technologies such as

Sharding

and

Layer 2 scaling solutions

have largely eliminated this problem.

Institutions that want to create their own blockchain may need high costs to recruit experts in this sector and create the necessary infrastructure. However, this problem can also be overcome by using successful public blockchains that already exist.

Users who lose their private keys can no longer access the data in their wallets or even their funds.

Blockchain networks that are not decentralized enough can be exploited with

51% attacks

.

Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than the average European country.

Bitcoin's carbon footprint

is also quite large. Energy usage density, which is a problem brought by the PoW algorithm, has been overcome with the PoS algorithm. Ethereum, which used the PoW algorithm from the day it was launched until September 2022,

has switched to the PoS algorithm

since that date.

Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. Bitcoin price has fluctuated between $17,700 and $68,800 in the last 1 year.

Cryptocurrencies can be used in criminal activities. There are cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash that can be used for money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal transactions due to the privacy they provide.

How blockchain provides security and privacy

One of the

biggest advantages of blockchain

to users is high security. It is very, very difficult to tamper with and change any old record, as the blocks are processed one after the other, and the data inside cannot be changed after they are validated.

We talked about miners, node operators, and consensus. In the PoW algorithm, each node operator has the right to vote as much as the computing power it provides to the network, and in the PoS algorithm, as much as the coin they stake. Any node operator can submit ideas and vote on ideas for any change in the network. In other words, in order to initiate a vote for a malicious change in the network and implement this malicious change, at least half of the network needs to vote positively.

As of September 25, 2022, 434,593 validators have staked

14,700,000 ETH

on Ethereum. In order for the Ethereum network to be exploited with a 51% attack, validators who have staked at least

7,350,000 ETH

in total must vote positive. This is something close to impossible, if not impossible.

Blockchain trilemma

Blockchain projects are built around three key features: scalability, decentralization, and security. Most projects have had to sacrifice one feature to make the other two stand out. The

scalability trilemma

introduced by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, is a mostly solved problem today. Let's take a closer look at the concepts that make up the trilemma:

Introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the blockchain trilemma states that crypto networks can only offer two of the three key benefits at any given time with respect to decentralization, security, and scalability.

Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a blockchain to handle an increasing number of transactions. A blockchain is adopted and used more by people, bringing with it more workload. Blockchains that scale well can process transactions efficiently.

Bitcoin can currently only process 7 transactions per second. Ethereum has been frequently criticized by its users for the scalability problems it faced, especially in 2021 and 2022. Only 30 transactions per second could be processed on the Ethereum network, and network congestion and high transaction costs were common. The transition to the PoS consensus mechanism in September 2022 started the

Ethereum 2.0

era, and scalability issues were overcome.

Blockchains that promise high transactions per second are often more centralized. Blockchains that provide scalability and security at the same time may have to renounce decentralization.

Decentralization

The decentralization feature of the blockchain, which ensures that it cannot be controlled by a central administration, requires multiple confirmations to validate a transaction. The need for approval by many validators for each transaction causes the processing time of transactions to be longer, thus slowing them down. This is why Bitcoin has an extremely slow network.

Security

A blockchain that is both decentralized and scalable has more node operators but needs fewer confirmations to validate transactions. This means that the blockchain is a little more vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately, there is nothing to worry about. Most blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot have overcome the trilemma problem, and there will likely be no such problems in the near future.

Innovations Provided by Blockchain

Since entering the mainstream in the 2010s, the research and development efforts in the blockchain space have resulted in some truly groundbreaking innovations, which will, in all likelihood, play a major role in finance, entertainment, and several other aspects of human life going forward.

Smart Contracts

Smart contracts

are arguably the biggest and most striking capability that blockchain technology has brought. Smart contracts ensure that all parties involved in a deal securely accept the terms of the contract. To be a little more precise, a smart contract is coded with the programming language, and everyone who signs this smart contract is subject to the same terms.

Smart contracts are arguably the most revolutionary blockchain innovation, allowing for the elimination of intermediaries in finance, insurance, judiciary, and other fields.

These algorithms, which are based on certain agreements and logic, work decentralized on blockchains. This feature ensures transparency, trust, and anonymity among all stakeholders. A smart contract can be used to connect with a DeFi dApp, make a swap, purchase an item in a

blockchain game

, and for any transaction to be performed on the blockchain.

NFTs

Non-Fungible Tokens

are unique assets that reflect all assets in the digital or real world. In-game items, artwork, music, videos, tickets, deeds, promissory notes, and more can be secured with

NFT technology

. Today, NFTs are used to protect copyrights, give ownership of in-game items to players, trade digital artworks, do virtual ticketing, and tokenize official documents.

DeFi

Decentralized finance

represents finance protocols built on blockchains. DeFi technology is used to trade cryptocurrencies, earn interest,

lend and borrow crypto

, store assets, and do other things that traditional finance enables decentralization.

DeFi has eliminated middlemen like credit cards, banks, and other financial institutions. The ability to carry out all financial transactions in a decentralized and anonymous manner, up to insurance, has started a new era of financial freedom.

Conclusion

Promising smart contracts, cross-border peer-to-peer payments, decentralized finance, monetization, metaverse, and more, blockchain technology is rapidly increasing use cases around the world. More users, companies, and governments are discovering how blockchain technology can help them and are supporting its further development.

This guide contains information on how blockchains work, what they do, what innovations they bring, and more. Even though we've covered blockchain technology as the foundation, this content is just the tip of the iceberg. If this content has piqued your interest, you should continue to learn about this amazing technology that will revolutionize the way we use the internet and finance.

Investopedia / Michela Buttignol

A robo-advisor (also sometimes spelled as roboadvisor) is a digital platform that provides automated, algorithm-driven financial planning and investment services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor asks questions about your financial situation and future goals through an online survey. It then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest for you.

Other common designations for robo-advisors include ""automated investment advisor,"" ""automated investment management,"" and ""digital advice platforms.""

The

best robo-advisors

offer easy account setup, robust goal planning, account services, and portfolio management. Additionally, they offer security features, comprehensive education, and low fees.

Key Takeaways

Robo-advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithmic investment services with minimal human supervision.

They often automate and optimize passive indexing strategies based on

modern portfolio theory

.

Robo-advisors are often inexpensive and require low opening balances, making them available to retail investors.

They are best suited for traditional investing and aren't the best options for more complex issues, such as estate planning.

Robo-advisors have been criticized for their lack of empathy and complexity.

Robo-Advisors: History and Investing Strategy

The first robo-advisors,

Betterment

and

Wealthfront

, launched in 2008. Wealthfront began as a mutual fund company. It planned to assist the tech community, then realized that computer software could make investment advice more accessible. Betterment, on the other hand, began with the initial purpose of rebalancing assets within

target-date funds (TDFs)

. It sought to help manage passive, buy-and-hold investments through a simple online interface.

The technology was nothing new. Human

wealth managers

have been using automated

portfolio allocation

software since the early 2000s. But until Betterment and Wealthfront launched, wealth managers were the only ones who could buy the technology, so clients had to employ a financial advisor to benefit from the innovation.

Today, most

robo-advisors use passive indexing strategies

that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Typically, the account holder can't choose which mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to invest in or purchase individual stocks or bonds in their account.

Some robo-advisors offer optimized portfolios for socially responsible investing (SRI), halal investing, or tactical strategies that mimic hedge funds. They also can handle much more sophisticated tasks, such as

tax-loss harvesting

, investment selection, and

retirement planning

.

Explosive Growth

The industry has experienced explosive growth. Client assets managed by robo-advisors are expected to reach $3 trillion in 2023, and $5 trillion worldwide by 2027.

Note

As of December 2022, the largest robo-advisor by assets under management (AUM) was Vanguard Digital Advisor, with $140.7 billion.

Portfolio Rebalancing

The majority of robo-advisors use modern portfolio theory (or some variant) to

build passive, indexed portfolios

for their users.

Once portfolios are established, robo-advisors continue to monitor them to ensure that the optimal asset-class weightings are maintained, even after market moves. Robo-advisors achieve this by using

rebalancing bands

.

Rebalancing Bands

In rebalancing bands, every

asset class

, or individual security, is given a target weight and a corresponding tolerance range. For example, an allocation strategy might include the requirement to hold 30% in

emerging market

equities, 30% in domestic blue chips, and 40% in

government bonds

with a corridor of ±5% for each asset class.

The use of rebalancing bands means that, given the ±5% corridor, emerging market and domestic blue-chip holdings can fluctuate between 25% and 35%. Government bonds can fluctuate between 35% and 45%. When the weight of a holding moves outside of the allowable band, the entire portfolio is

rebalanced

to reflect the initial target composition.

In the past, this type of subtle rebalancing was frowned upon because it was time-consuming and generated transaction fees. However, low-fee robo-advisors are designed to handle rebalancing automatically.

Tax-Loss Harvesting

Another type of rebalancing commonly found with robo-advisors—made cost-effective through algorithms—is tax-loss harvesting.

Tax-loss harvesting

is a strategy that involves selling securities at a loss to offset a capital-gains tax liability.

This strategy is typically employed to limit the recognition of

short-term capital gains

. Robo-advisors do this by maintaining two or more stable ETFs for each asset class. So, if the S&P 500 ETF loses value, a robo-advisor will automatically sell it to lock in a capital loss; simultaneously, it buys a different S&P 500 ETF.

It's worth bearing in mind that the IRS

wash-sale rule

prevents investors from re-purchasing the same security or a security that is substantially identical within 30 days from its sell date.

However, robo-investment platforms should have algorithms in place that incorporate rules like this.

Make sure your robo-advisor is programmed to select ETFs appropriately so that you avoid wash- sale violations.

Benefits of Robo-Advisors vs. Traditional Financial Advisors

The emergence of robo-advisors has broken down some of the traditional barriers between the financial services world and average consumers. Because of these online platforms, sound financial planning is now accessible to almost everyone, not just high-net-worth individuals.

Robo-advisors are low-cost alternatives to traditional advisors. By eliminating human labor, online platforms can offer the same services at a fraction of the cost.

Most robo-advisors charge annual flat

fees

of less than 0.4% per specific amount managed. That is much less than the typical 1% charged by a human financial planner (or more for

commission-based

accounts).

With robo-advisors, it's generally easier to keep tabs on investments. You can log in 24/7 as long as you have an internet connection.

It takes significantly less capital to start investing when using robo-advisors. One of the most popular robo-advisors, Betterment, has no account minimum for its basic account offering.

Robo-advisors are efficient. Before robo-advisors and online brokerage accounts, if you wanted to execute a trade, you'd have to call or meet with a financial advisor, explain your needs, and wait for them to execute your trades. Now, you can do all of that with the click of a few buttons in the comfort of your home.

Though using a robo-advisor may limit your investment options, this can be beneficial because buying individual stocks or trying to beat the market can produce poor results. On average, ordinary investors often see better results with an

indexing

strategy.

Some human advisors won't take on clients with less than $25,000, $50,000, or maybe even $100,000 in investable assets.

Limitations of Robo-Advisors

Many in the industry have doubts about the viability of digital advisors as a one-size-fits-all solution to wealth management.

Given their current technological capabilities and minimal human presence, robo-advisors

have been criticized

for lacking empathy and sophistication.

Robo-advisors are good entry-level options if you have a small account and limited investment experience. You may find them lacking if you need services like estate planning, complicated tax management, trust fund administration, and retirement planning.

Automated services are also ill-equipped to deal with unexpected crises or extraordinary situations. For example, robo-advisors won't know if you're between jobs or dealing with an unexpected expense—your funds could be drained unexpectedly by automatic withdrawals.

A study conducted by Investopedia and the

Financial Planning Association

found that consumers prefer a combination of human and technological guidance, especially when times are rough. According to the report, 40% of participants said they wouldn't be comfortable using an automated investing platform during extreme market volatility.

Robo-advisors operate on the assumption that you have defined goals and a clear understanding of your financial circumstances, investment concepts, and potential investment outcomes. For many investors, that is not the case.

Pros

Convenient, easy access

Lower cost, low starting capital

Investment experience not required

Straightforward index investing

Growing number of valuable services

Cons

Lacks human interaction

Limited investment opportunities

Investor must define financial situation and investment goals

One-size-approach not right for all

Uneven technology standards

Hiring a Robo-Advisor

Robo advisors don't all cost the same amount and offer all the same features. Each one may excel in particular areas, so it's important to do some research first. Dedicating a bit of time to finding the right one could turn out to be one of your smartest investments.

There are also hybrid robo-advisors, which essentially seek to combine the benefits of automated investment with human financial advice.

Opening a robo-advisor account usually entails completing a short, risk-profiling questionnaire and evaluating your financial situation,

time horizon

, and personal investment goals. In many cases, you will have the opportunity to link your bank account directly for quick and easy funding of your robo-advisory account.

Target Demographic

Many digital platforms target and attract certain demographics more than others. For robo-advisors, these include

Millennial

and Generation Z investors who are technology-savvy and still accumulating their investable assets.

This population is much more comfortable sharing personal information online and entrusting technology with essential tasks, such as wealth management. Indeed, the marketing efforts of robo-advisory firms typically employ social media channels to reach these investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a risk alert to investors in November 2021 regarding compliance issues with many robo-advisors. Be sure to stay informed of these and other issues by checking FINRA Investor Alerts and the SEC Division of Examination websites for information.

Robo-Advisors and Regulation

Robo-advisors hold the same legal status as human advisors. Accordingly, they must be registered with the

SEC

and are subject to the same securities laws and regulations as traditional

broker-dealers

.

Most robo-advisors are members of the

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

. You can use

BrokerCheck

to research robo-advisors in the same way that you would a human advisor.

Assets managed by robo-advisors aren't insured by the

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)

. That's because they are securities held for investment purposes, not bank deposits.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean clients are unprotected. For example, Wealthfront is insured by the

Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC)

, meaning that if the company goes bust, investors will be reimbursed up to $500,000 of their invested balance.

As you research robo-advisors, don't forget to check on the kind of insurance each has to protect your investment.

How Robo-Advisors Get Paid

The primary way that most robo-advisors get paid is through a

wrap fee

based on

assets under management (AUM)

. While traditional (human) financial advisors typically charge 1% or more of AUM per year, many robo-advisors charge around 0.3% of AUM per year.

Another revenue stream is

payment for order flow (PFOF)

. This payment (typically fractions of a penny per share) results from directing trade orders to a particular market maker. PFOF can potentially result in better execution prices for clients. Typically, robo-advisors bundle various trade orders together into large block orders executed just one or two times a day.

Finally, robo-advisors can earn money by marketing targeted financial products and services to their customers, such as mortgages,

credit cards

, or insurance policies. This is often done through strategic partnerships rather than advertising networks.

If the costs of your robo-advisor outweigh returns on your investments, then you may be better off not using one.

The Best-in-Class Robo-Advisors

There are hundreds of robo-advisors available in the U.S. and worldwide. More of them launch every year. They all provide some combination of investment management, retirement planning, and general financial advice.

When

evaluating a robo-advisor

, pay attention to what it invests in, as some are now moving away from passive index strategies and investing in more risky areas that could underperform the market.

What Does a Robo-Advisor Do?

Robo-advisors provide financial planning services through automated algorithms with no human intervention. They start by gathering information from a client through an online survey and then automatically invest for the client based on that data. Robo-advisors often use passive index investing strategies.

Can Robo-Advisors Make You Money?

Yes, you can make money with a robo-advisor, as you can with any other financial advisor.

Can You Lose Money With Robo-Advisors?

Yes, you can lose money with robo-advisors if investments lose value or costs outpace portfolio returns.

Do Robo-Advisors Beat the Market?

Most robo-advisors won't beat the market. That's because their investing involves a passive index strategy that seeks only to replicate the market's return. Typically, robo-advisor investing is based on modern portfolio theory, which relates to constructing a portfolio that maximizes return within an acceptable level of risk.

The Bottom Line

Robo-advisors leverage advances in algorithmic trading and electronic markets to automate investment strategies for ordinary investors.

Often based on modern portfolio theory, robo-advisors are able to optimize investors'

risk-return tradeoffs

and automatically manage and rebalance their portfolios. Automation also allows for tax-loss harvesting and other strategies that were once too complex or expensive for ordinary investors.

With low fees and small minimum balances required to get started, robo-advisors may be a good choice for most long-term investors and may be especially attractive to younger, tech-forward individuals.

NerdWallet, Inc. is an independent publisher and comparison service, not an investment advisor. Its articles, interactive tools and other content are provided to you for free, as self-help tools and for informational purposes only. They are not intended to provide investment advice. NerdWallet does not and cannot guarantee the accuracy or applicability of any information in regard to your individual circumstances. Examples are hypothetical, and we encourage you to seek personalized advice from qualified professionals regarding specific investment issues. Our estimates are based on past market performance, and past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesn’t feature every company or financial product available on the market, we’re proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward — and free.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research.

Methodology

NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks the largest U.S. brokers and robo-advisors. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which ones will best meet your needs. We adhere to strict guidelines for

editorial integrity.

We collect data directly from providers through detailed questionnaires, and conduct first-hand testing and observation through provider demonstrations. The questionnaire answers, combined with demonstrations, interviews of personnel at the providers and our specialists’ hands-on research, fuel our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance across more than 20 factors. The final output produces star ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars).

Frequently asked questions

What is a robo-advisor?

Robo-advisors automate investment management by using computer algorithms to build you a portfolio and manage your assets based on your goals and your tolerance for risk. Since portfolio management is handled by software rather than a human financial advisor, robo-advisors charge lower fees, which can translate to higher long-term returns for investors.

How do you open an account with a robo-advisor?

Opening a robo-advisor account is very similar to

opening a brokerage account

or bank account: You'll provide some personal information and then link an existing account from which you can transfer money to fund the new account. The primary difference is in most cases, robo-advisors will take you through an onboarding quiz to help determine how to invest your portfolio. These quizzes generally ask about your investment goals, risk tolerance and time horizon, and the robo-advisor will use your answers to build the most optimal portfolio for you.

How does a robo-advisor work?

Robo-advisors use advanced software to handle many of the tasks that used to require expensive experts to manage. Services range from automatic rebalancing to tax optimization, and require little to no human interaction. A robo-advisor might be a good fit if you prefer to be largely hands-off with your investments and you don’t have the kind of complex financial situation that requires a direct relationship with a human financial advisor.

That said, many providers offer access to human advisors available for questions related to account management or long-term investment planning — though these services may cost more.

How should you choose a robo-advisor?

Here’s what you should consider:

Management fees.

This is what you’ll pay annually to have an account at a robo-advisor.

Expense ratios.

These are like management fees, only they’re paid not to the robo-advisor, but to the investments the robo-advisor uses. Mutual funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds all charge this annual fee to cover the costs of running the fund.

Account types.

Investment accounts fall into two general categories: Retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s, that offer tax advantages while adhering to certain rules; and taxable accounts, where there are no specific tax advantages but also no limits on contributions or distributions.

Investments.

Most robo-advisors use low-cost index funds and ETFs.

Rebalancing.

Portfolios are fluid, and market fluctuations can cause the mix of investments you hold to get out of sync with your goals. Rebalancing brings that allocation back to its original mix.

Access to human advisors.

Many robo-advisors have merged computer-driven portfolio management with access to human financial advisors. Some services offer a dedicated advisor to individual clients; others offer only email or online chat with a team of advisors.

Investopedia / Michela Buttignol

A robo-advisor (also sometimes spelled as roboadvisor) is a digital platform that provides automated, algorithm-driven financial planning and investment services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor asks questions about your financial situation and future goals through an online survey. It then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest for you.

Other common designations for robo-advisors include ""automated investment advisor,"" ""automated investment management,"" and ""digital advice platforms.""

The

best robo-advisors

offer easy account setup, robust goal planning, account services, and portfolio management. Additionally, they offer security features, comprehensive education, and low fees.

Key Takeaways

Robo-advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithmic investment services with minimal human supervision.

They often automate and optimize passive indexing strategies based on

modern portfolio theory

.

Robo-advisors are often inexpensive and require low opening balances, making them available to retail investors.

They are best suited for traditional investing and aren't the best options for more complex issues, such as estate planning.

Robo-advisors have been criticized for their lack of empathy and complexity.

Robo-Advisors: History and Investing Strategy

The first robo-advisors,

Betterment

and

Wealthfront

, launched in 2008. Wealthfront began as a mutual fund company. It planned to assist the tech community, then realized that computer software could make investment advice more accessible. Betterment, on the other hand, began with the initial purpose of rebalancing assets within

target-date funds (TDFs)

. It sought to help manage passive, buy-and-hold investments through a simple online interface.

The technology was nothing new. Human

wealth managers

have been using automated

portfolio allocation

software since the early 2000s. But until Betterment and Wealthfront launched, wealth managers were the only ones who could buy the technology, so clients had to employ a financial advisor to benefit from the innovation.

Today, most

robo-advisors use passive indexing strategies

that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Typically, the account holder can't choose which mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to invest in or purchase individual stocks or bonds in their account.

Some robo-advisors offer optimized portfolios for socially responsible investing (SRI), halal investing, or tactical strategies that mimic hedge funds. They also can handle much more sophisticated tasks, such as

tax-loss harvesting

, investment selection, and

retirement planning

.

Explosive Growth

The industry has experienced explosive growth. Client assets managed by robo-advisors are expected to reach $3 trillion in 2023, and $5 trillion worldwide by 2027.

Note

As of December 2022, the largest robo-advisor by assets under management (AUM) was Vanguard Digital Advisor, with $140.7 billion.

Portfolio Rebalancing

The majority of robo-advisors use modern portfolio theory (or some variant) to

build passive, indexed portfolios

for their users.

Once portfolios are established, robo-advisors continue to monitor them to ensure that the optimal asset-class weightings are maintained, even after market moves. Robo-advisors achieve this by using

rebalancing bands

.

Rebalancing Bands

In rebalancing bands, every

asset class

, or individual security, is given a target weight and a corresponding tolerance range. For example, an allocation strategy might include the requirement to hold 30% in

emerging market

equities, 30% in domestic blue chips, and 40% in

government bonds

with a corridor of ±5% for each asset class.

The use of rebalancing bands means that, given the ±5% corridor, emerging market and domestic blue-chip holdings can fluctuate between 25% and 35%. Government bonds can fluctuate between 35% and 45%. When the weight of a holding moves outside of the allowable band, the entire portfolio is

rebalanced

to reflect the initial target composition.

In the past, this type of subtle rebalancing was frowned upon because it was time-consuming and generated transaction fees. However, low-fee robo-advisors are designed to handle rebalancing automatically.

Tax-Loss Harvesting

Another type of rebalancing commonly found with robo-advisors—made cost-effective through algorithms—is tax-loss harvesting.

Tax-loss harvesting

is a strategy that involves selling securities at a loss to offset a capital-gains tax liability.

This strategy is typically employed to limit the recognition of

short-term capital gains

. Robo-advisors do this by maintaining two or more stable ETFs for each asset class. So, if the S&P 500 ETF loses value, a robo-advisor will automatically sell it to lock in a capital loss; simultaneously, it buys a different S&P 500 ETF.

It's worth bearing in mind that the IRS

wash-sale rule

prevents investors from re-purchasing the same security or a security that is substantially identical within 30 days from its sell date.

However, robo-investment platforms should have algorithms in place that incorporate rules like this.

Make sure your robo-advisor is programmed to select ETFs appropriately so that you avoid wash- sale violations.

Benefits of Robo-Advisors vs. Traditional Financial Advisors

The emergence of robo-advisors has broken down some of the traditional barriers between the financial services world and average consumers. Because of these online platforms, sound financial planning is now accessible to almost everyone, not just high-net-worth individuals.

Robo-advisors are low-cost alternatives to traditional advisors. By eliminating human labor, online platforms can offer the same services at a fraction of the cost.

Most robo-advisors charge annual flat

fees

of less than 0.4% per specific amount managed. That is much less than the typical 1% charged by a human financial planner (or more for

commission-based

accounts).

With robo-advisors, it's generally easier to keep tabs on investments. You can log in 24/7 as long as you have an internet connection.

It takes significantly less capital to start investing when using robo-advisors. One of the most popular robo-advisors, Betterment, has no account minimum for its basic account offering.

Robo-advisors are efficient. Before robo-advisors and online brokerage accounts, if you wanted to execute a trade, you'd have to call or meet with a financial advisor, explain your needs, and wait for them to execute your trades. Now, you can do all of that with the click of a few buttons in the comfort of your home.

Though using a robo-advisor may limit your investment options, this can be beneficial because buying individual stocks or trying to beat the market can produce poor results. On average, ordinary investors often see better results with an

indexing

strategy.

Some human advisors won't take on clients with less than $25,000, $50,000, or maybe even $100,000 in investable assets.

Limitations of Robo-Advisors

Many in the industry have doubts about the viability of digital advisors as a one-size-fits-all solution to wealth management.

Given their current technological capabilities and minimal human presence, robo-advisors

have been criticized

for lacking empathy and sophistication.

Robo-advisors are good entry-level options if you have a small account and limited investment experience. You may find them lacking if you need services like estate planning, complicated tax management, trust fund administration, and retirement planning.

Automated services are also ill-equipped to deal with unexpected crises or extraordinary situations. For example, robo-advisors won't know if you're between jobs or dealing with an unexpected expense—your funds could be drained unexpectedly by automatic withdrawals.

A study conducted by Investopedia and the

Financial Planning Association

found that consumers prefer a combination of human and technological guidance, especially when times are rough. According to the report, 40% of participants said they wouldn't be comfortable using an automated investing platform during extreme market volatility.

Robo-advisors operate on the assumption that you have defined goals and a clear understanding of your financial circumstances, investment concepts, and potential investment outcomes. For many investors, that is not the case.

Pros

Convenient, easy access

Lower cost, low starting capital

Investment experience not required

Straightforward index investing

Growing number of valuable services

Cons

Lacks human interaction

Limited investment opportunities

Investor must define financial situation and investment goals

One-size-approach not right for all

Uneven technology standards

Hiring a Robo-Advisor

Robo advisors don't all cost the same amount and offer all the same features. Each one may excel in particular areas, so it's important to do some research first. Dedicating a bit of time to finding the right one could turn out to be one of your smartest investments.

There are also hybrid robo-advisors, which essentially seek to combine the benefits of automated investment with human financial advice.

Opening a robo-advisor account usually entails completing a short, risk-profiling questionnaire and evaluating your financial situation,

time horizon

, and personal investment goals. In many cases, you will have the opportunity to link your bank account directly for quick and easy funding of your robo-advisory account.

Target Demographic

Many digital platforms target and attract certain demographics more than others. For robo-advisors, these include

Millennial

and Generation Z investors who are technology-savvy and still accumulating their investable assets.

This population is much more comfortable sharing personal information online and entrusting technology with essential tasks, such as wealth management. Indeed, the marketing efforts of robo-advisory firms typically employ social media channels to reach these investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a risk alert to investors in November 2021 regarding compliance issues with many robo-advisors. Be sure to stay informed of these and other issues by checking FINRA Investor Alerts and the SEC Division of Examination websites for information.

Robo-Advisors and Regulation

Robo-advisors hold the same legal status as human advisors. Accordingly, they must be registered with the

SEC

and are subject to the same securities laws and regulations as traditional

broker-dealers

.

Most robo-advisors are members of the

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

. You can use

BrokerCheck

to research robo-advisors in the same way that you would a human advisor.

Assets managed by robo-advisors aren't insured by the

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)

. That's because they are securities held for investment purposes, not bank deposits.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean clients are unprotected. For example, Wealthfront is insured by the

Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC)

, meaning that if the company goes bust, investors will be reimbursed up to $500,000 of their invested balance.

As you research robo-advisors, don't forget to check on the kind of insurance each has to protect your investment.

How Robo-Advisors Get Paid

The primary way that most robo-advisors get paid is through a

wrap fee

based on

assets under management (AUM)

. While traditional (human) financial advisors typically charge 1% or more of AUM per year, many robo-advisors charge around 0.3% of AUM per year.

Another revenue stream is

payment for order flow (PFOF)

. This payment (typically fractions of a penny per share) results from directing trade orders to a particular market maker. PFOF can potentially result in better execution prices for clients. Typically, robo-advisors bundle various trade orders together into large block orders executed just one or two times a day.

Finally, robo-advisors can earn money by marketing targeted financial products and services to their customers, such as mortgages,

credit cards

, or insurance policies. This is often done through strategic partnerships rather than advertising networks.

If the costs of your robo-advisor outweigh returns on your investments, then you may be better off not using one.

The Best-in-Class Robo-Advisors

When

evaluating a robo-advisor

, pay attention to what it invests in, as some are now moving away from passive index strategies and investing in more risky areas that could underperform the market.

What Does a Robo-Advisor Do?

Robo-advisors provide financial planning services through automated algorithms with no human intervention. They start by gathering information from a client through an online survey and then automatically invest for the client based on that data. Robo-advisors often use passive index investing strategies.

Can Robo-Advisors Make You Money?

Yes, you can make money with a robo-advisor, as you can with any other financial advisor.

Can You Lose Money With Robo-Advisors?

Yes, you can lose money with robo-advisors if investments lose value or costs outpace portfolio returns.

Do Robo-Advisors Beat the Market?

Most robo-advisors won't beat the market. That's because their investing involves a passive index strategy that seeks only to replicate the market's return. Typically, robo-advisor investing is based on modern portfolio theory, which relates to constructing a portfolio that maximizes return within an acceptable level of risk.

The Bottom Line

Robo-advisors leverage advances in algorithmic trading and electronic markets to automate investment strategies for ordinary investors.

Often based on modern portfolio theory, robo-advisors are able to optimize investors'

risk-return tradeoffs

and automatically manage and rebalance their portfolios. Automation also allows for tax-loss harvesting and other strategies that were once too complex or expensive for ordinary investors.

With low fees and small minimum balances required to get started, robo-advisors may be a good choice for most long-term investors and may be especially attractive to younger, tech-forward individuals.

What is Algorithmic Trading?

Algorithmic trading is a process for executing orders utilizing

automated and pre-programmed trading instructions

to account for variables such as price, timing, and volume. An

algorithm

is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer algorithms send small portions of the full order to the market over time.

Algorithmic trading makes use of complex formulas, combined with mathematical models and human oversight, to make decisions to buy or sell financial securities on an exchange. Algorithmic traders often make use of

high-frequency trading

technology, which can enable a firm to make tens of thousands of trades per second. Algorithmic trading can be used in a wide variety of situations including order execution, arbitrage, and

trend trading

strategies.

Key Takeaways

Algorithmic trading is the use of process- and rules-based algorithms to employ strategies for executing trades.

It has grown significantly in popularity since the early 1980s and is used by institutional investors and large trading firms for a variety of purposes.

While it provides advantages, such as faster execution time and reduced costs, algorithmic trading can also exacerbate the market's negative tendencies by causing flash crashes and immediate loss of liquidity.

Understanding Algorithmic Trading

The use of algorithms in trading increased after computerized trading systems were introduced in American financial markets during the 1970s. In 1976, the

New York Stock Exchange

introduced the

Designated Order Turnaround (DOT)

system for routing orders from traders to specialists on the exchange floor.

﻿

﻿ In the following decades, exchanges enhanced their abilities to accept electronic trading, and by 2009, upwards of 60 percent of all trades in the U.S. were executed by computers.

﻿

﻿

Author Michael Lewis brought high-frequency, algorithmic trading to the public’s attention when he published the best-selling book

Flash Boys

, which documented the lives of

Wall Street

traders and entrepreneurs who helped build the companies that came to define the structure of electronic trading in America. His book argued that these companies were engaged in an arms race to build ever faster computers, which could communicate with exchanges ever more quickly, to gain advantage on competitors with speed, using order types which benefited them to the detriment of average investors.

Do-It-Yourself Algorithmic Trading

In recent years, the practice of do-it-yourself algorithmic trading has become widespread.

Hedge funds

like Quantopian, for instance, crowd source algorithms from amateur programmers who compete to win commissions for writing the most profitable code. The practice has been made possible by the spread of high-speed internet and the development of ever-faster computers at relatively cheap prices. Platforms like Quantiacs have sprung up in order to serve day traders who wish to try their hand at algorithmic trading.

Another emergent technology on Wall Street is machine learning. New developments in

artificial intelligence

have enabled computer programmers to develop programs which can improve themselves through an iterative process called deep learning. Traders are developing algorithms that rely on deep learning to make themselves more profitable.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading is mainly used by institutional investors and big brokerage houses to cut down on costs associated with trading. According to research, algorithmic trading is especially beneficial for large order sizes that may comprise as much as 10% of overall trading volume.

Typically market makers use algorithmic trades to create liquidity.

Algorithmic trading also allows for faster and easier execution of orders, making it attractive for exchanges. In turn, this means that traders and investors can quickly book profits off small changes in price. The

scalping

trading strategy commonly employs algorithms because it involves rapid buying and selling of securities at small price increments.

The speed of order execution, an advantage in ordinary circumstances, can become a problem when several orders are executed simultaneously without human intervention. The flash crash of 2010 has

been blamed

on algorithmic trading.

Another disadvantage of algorithmic trades is that liquidity, which is created through rapid buy and sell orders, can disappear in a moment, eliminating the chance for traders to profit off price changes. It can also lead to instant loss of liquidity. Research has uncovered that algorithmic trading was a major factor in causing a loss of liquidity in currency markets after the Swiss franc discontinued its Euro peg in 2015.

What Is Online Banking?

Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.

Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of

online banking

you can access through a computer or app.

Key Takeaways

Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet.

You aren't required to visit a bank branch in order to complete basic online banking transactions.

You need a device, an Internet connection, and a bank card to register for online banking.

Understanding Online Banking

With online banking, you aren't required to visit a bank branch to complete most of your basic banking transactions. You can do all of this at your own convenience, wherever you want—at home, at work, or on the go. Online banking can be done using a browser or app.

Mobile banking

is online banking that is done on a phone or tablet.

Using online banking requires a computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other device, plus an Internet connection and a bank or

debit card

. In order to access the service, you need to register for the bank's online banking service and create a password. Once that's done, you can use the service to do your banking.

Banking transactions offered online vary by institution. Most banks generally offer basic services such as

transfers

and bill payments. Some banks also allow customers to open up new accounts and apply for credit cards through online banking portals. Other functions may include ordering checks, putting stop payments on checks, or reporting a change of address.

Checks can be deposited online through a mobile app using

remote deposit capture

. Enter the check amount, then use the app to take a photo of the front and back of the check to complete the deposit.

Online banking typically does not permit the purchase of

traveler's checks

, bank drafts, or certain wire transfers. It also typically does not permit the completion of certain credit applications, such as for mortgages. These transactions still need to take place face-to-face with a bank representative.

Most banks do not charge fees for online banking.

Online Banks

Online banks operate exclusively online, with no physical branch at all. The

best online banks

offer low-cost or free banking, plus above-average yields on savings accounts and tools to help you manage your money.

Online-only banks may not provide direct ATM access but will make provisions for customers to use ATMs at other banks and retail stores. They may reimburse you for some of the ATM fees charged by other

financial institutions

. Reduced overhead costs associated with not having physical branches typically allow online banks to offer significant savings on banking fees. They also offer higher interest rates on savings accounts.

These banks handle customer service by phone, email, or online chat, instead of in person.

Prominent online banks in the United States include

Ally Bank

,

Discover Bank

, and

Synchrony Bank

.

Advantages of Online Banking

Convenience is a major advantage of online banking. Basic banking transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds between accounts can easily be done any time of the day or night, seven days a week. If your bank offers a payment network such as

Zelle

, you can use your online bank account to send money to another person.

Online banking is fast and efficient. Funds can be transferred between accounts almost instantly, especially if the two accounts are held at the same institution.

You can open and close a number of different accounts online, from fixed deposits to recurring deposit accounts that typically offer higher rates of interest.

You can also monitor your accounts closely, allowing you to keep your accounts safe. Around-the-clock access to banking information provides early detection of fraudulent activity, thereby acting as a guardrail against financial damage or loss.

Disadvantages of Online Banking

For a novice online banking customer, using electronic systems for the first time may present challenges that prevent transactions from being processed, which is why some people prefer face-to-face transactions with a teller.

Online banking doesn't help if you need access to large amounts of cash. While you may be able to withdraw a certain amount at the

automatic teller machine

(ATM)—most cards come with a limit—you will have to visit a branch to get the rest.

Although online banking security is continually improving, such accounts are still vulnerable when it comes to hacking. Customers are advised to use their own data plans, rather than public wifi networks, when using online banking to prevent unauthorized access.

Additionally, online banking is dependent on a reliable Internet connection. Connectivity issues from time to time may make it difficult to determine if banking transactions have been successfully processed.

What do you need for online banking?

To use online banking, you'll need an Internet connection and a device, such as a computer or mobile phone. You might also need your bank card, debit card, or account number and routing number. You'll have to register your account, which will require you to set a password.

How can you use online banking safely?

To protect your money as well as your personal information, it's important to take advantage of the various security features your bank offers. Set a strong, unique password, and change it regularly (once a quarter is a good start). Use a password manager program to help you set and remember strong passwords.

Enable two-factor or multi-factor authentication if your bank offers it. Never give your online banking details to anyone, and avoid online banking if you're using public WiFi.

Check your accounts regularly, and report suspected fraud immediately.

Can you use online banking to pay bills each month?

Yes, you can use online banking to pay your bills on time every month. You can log in to your online banking account each month to arrange bill payments, or you can set up automatic payments. Online bill pay is a simple way to automate your bills and ensure you're never

late on a payment

. It works especially well for bills with regular, set amounts, such as a mortgage, insurance, or car payment,

The Bottom Line

Online banking is a fast, inexpensive, and convenient way to handle many of your everyday financial transactions.

If you already have a bank, you likely have access to online banking; all you need to do is register. And while you can use a traditional, ""brick-and-mortar"" bank's online

banking features

, choosing an online-only bank for all of your banking needs might boost the interest you earn on savings and help save money on fees.

Banks are revamping their digital strategies to make better use of technology at their companies.

AI and cloud tech are giving some banks an edge over competitors and enticing brand loyalty.

Outdated IT systems are hard to modernize, but they must be updated to meet current needs.

It might be hard to remember the last time you visited a bank branch for a financial service. You likely conduct most of your banking via apps and websites, whether you're paying bills, seeking help for a transaction, or checking your account balance after an expensive night out at your local cocktail bar.

In a 2023 GoBankingRates survey of US consumers, 59% of respondents said they would rather

bank with smartphone applications

, and 22% said they were more inclined to use banking websites. Meanwhile, 19% said they preferred physical branches and ATMs to online banking.

However, online banking is only a small part of the digital transformation underway in the sector as innovations such as

AI-driven tools and cloud technology

radically restyle the industry.

Traditional banks that ignore this reality risk losing loyal customers to digital banks that have emerged over the past few years, research suggests. A study from the banking-tech company 10x found that bad

customer experience could result in banks

losing 20% of their customers.

Experts told Insider that implementing a comprehensive digital strategy blending current and emerging technologies would put banks in a better position to maintain brand loyalty with customers and increase their competitive advantage.

Digital transformation is a must for banks

With online banking now the norm, digital transformation is no longer optional for banks. It's a ""necessity to remain competitive and meet customers' evolving needs,"" said Victoria Newton, the chief product officer of Engine by Starling Bank, the cloud-banking software used at Starling.

Victoria Newton, the chief product officer of Engine by Starling Bank.

Engine by Starling

But effective tech in the banking sector should go beyond apps and cloud migration, Newton said. She advised banks to rethink their technical operations and transform legacy, or outdated, IT systems to ""continuously improve and adapt.""

""It's integral to the longevity of banks. Legacy banking systems were not designed to provide the banking experience that people expect today,"" she said. ""Simply changing the customer channels without attacking the core and customer-servicing systems cannot deliver the customer experience or low cost to serve what digitally native banks can.""

Changes in customer habits and technological developments have made the banking sector ""incredibly competitive,"" Laura Merling, the chief transformation and operations officer of the financial-services provider Arvest Bank, said.

Banking firms must invest in digital tools such as cloud platforms and generative artificial intelligence to ""meet customers where, when, and how they want to bank,"" Merling added. Doing so will help banks benefit from additional revenue streams, improve the customer experience, and streamline operations, she said.

Jay Venkateswaran, the business-unit head of banking and financial services at the business-process-management firm WNS, said digital transformation strategies could also help banks lower transaction and operating costs.

Fintechs that have sprung up over the past decade are leveraging digital channels and offshoring to ""ensure minimal operating costs,"" he said, adding: ""Accordingly, the operating cost for such firms has been far lower than traditional banks who continue to leverage branch and onshore call centers apart from digital channels.""

For example, many banks have replaced physical branches and call-center teams with live chats and FAQ website sections to reduce the overhead of their customer-support functions.

AI is automating banking transactions and processes

Banks are increasingly automating the banking experience by adopting AI tools and developing AI-generated products. For example, Capital One offers an

AI-powered customer assistant called Eno

. It detects and flags suspicious account activity, answers questions over text messages, makes suggestions to help improve customer spending habits, pays bills, and checks account balances.

Goldman Sachs is another major bank that sees massive potential in AI technology. In March, the firm announced that its software developers were exploring ways

AI tools could help them write and test code

automatically. The aim is to improve productivity in the bank's software-development department. In the long run, it could help banks accelerate product development, further improving their competitive edge and satisfying evolving customer expectations.

Nigel Vaz, the CEO of Publicis Sapient.

Nigel Vaz, the CEO of

Publicis Sapient

, a consultancy for digital business management and transformation, told Insider that

AI could also provide protections

such as

cyberdefenses

and

fraud detection

. Meanwhile, Venkateswaran views AI as a ""powerful tool"" for increasing the speed and efficiency of banking transactions, he said.

Cloud is powering the world's biggest banks

From

Morgan Stanley's cloud transformation

partnership with Microsoft to

Bank of America

saving $2 billion a year with its private cloud, banks are adopting cloud-computing infrastructure as they look to launch products and services that are fit for purpose in 2023.

This process involves transferring a company's IT infrastructure, apps, and databases onto a cloud-computing server provided by platforms such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.

Cloud adoption offers immense opportunities for banks. In an

Economist Intelligence Unit survey

, 72% of IT executives in the banking sector said they viewed cloud tech as a means to ""achieve their business priorities.""

Laura Merling, the chief transformation and operations officer of Arvest Bank.

Arvest Bank

""By moving to the cloud, banks are able to take tightly tied legacy systems and technologies and make them more flexible for swapping out vendors, seamlessly connecting customers with back-office support functions and accessing all your data in one place for a single view of the customer,"" Merling said.

As a result, banking customers and employees can view transactions in real time and deliver ""a more seamless and personalized experience"" for all stakeholders, she added.

Cloud technology is also accelerating innovation across the banking industry. Newton told Insider: ""Cloud architectures are critical as they allow banks to be able to make the most of technologies like generative AI, innovative subscription services, or programs to help bolster loyalty at a channel level with customers.""

Over the next decade, Venkateswaran expects technological advancements aided by the cloud to ""take center stage in the banking sector"" and ""enable banks to offer higher levels of security and control, thanks to the implementation of cutting-edge blockchain and AI solutions,"" he said.

Unlocking new possibilities with Web3

The next iteration of the internet, known as Web3, will likely bring new possibilities to the banking industry. In particular,

Web3 technologies such as cryptocurrencies

, blockchains, smart contracts, and nonfungible tokens are ""introducing a new security standard for financial interactions"" as customers expect more reassurance in their financial dealings, Venkateswaran said.

He expects the metaverse, an immersive online world, to have a major impact.

""By creating virtual spaces for banking, this innovative approach promises to provide customers with personalized and immersive interactions like never before,"" he said.

Vaz also believes that blockchain technology will transform the operations of banks, leading to ""more secure, efficient, and transparent"" banking transactions, he said, adding: ""This could lead to cost savings and improved customer trust, thereby enhancing brand loyalty.""

Navigating vast digital changes

From AI to the metaverse, many technologies are available for banks looking to stay competitive and retain brand loyalty. But, of course, many of these technologies will be new to banks, and they might experience teething problems with adoption.

James Whybrow, the head of financial services at Software AG.

Software AG

For banks with legacy IT systems, pairing them with newer infrastructure might be challenging because they likely weren't designed to handle today's technical and security requirements.

But doing so is necessary for achieving ""a holistic view of the business and its operational processes,"" James Whybrow, the head of financial services at the German tech giant Software AG, said.

""Comprehensive integration should be the first consideration when embarking on a digital-transformation project, or else companies risk lost data and rendering some systems obsolete, unable to communicate with any new software,"" he said.

Merling said most digital-transformation projects were unsuccessful because of ""a lack of engagement, insufficient investment, and missed objectives."" To ensure digital-transformation projects succeed, Merling said banks must be communicative and set clear goals and responsibilities for everyone involved.

""Create opportunities for engagement across the business so it feels like 'our' transformation, not just 'yours,'"" Merling said. ""And be sure to measure your success along the way.""

With online banking services, companies can save both time and resources while also keeping track of their expenses in a convenient and cost-efficient way. Gone are the days when a company representative had to go to the bank in-person to deposit a check or withdraw cash for wages, as all of these operations can now be done almost exclusively online.

Small business owners especially stand to gain a lot from using their bank's online services to generate value and save time -- time that can be dedicated to growing the organization instead. To help business owners better navigate the world of online financial operations, we asked nine members of

Forbes Finance Council

for their opinions on some of the key benefits of online banking that entrepreneurs tend to overlook.

Member explain why online banking is great for small businesses.

1. Seamless Syncing With Accounting

Accounting is one of the biggest pains for business owners. Online banking and online accounting systems have made it easier than ever to make sure you have all of your transactions synced with your accounting system without needing to spend hours manually adding transactions. This saves business owners time and money and makes it easier to have up-to-date financial reports. -

Brian Hayes

,

NOW CFO

2. Improved Security

At some point, you may need others to manage your books. Online banking allows small businesses to customize employee access. Since not all employees need access to all accounts, online banking enables features to share certain content with select employee logins. The online account can be set up on a need-to-know basis and thus improves your overall company financial security. -

Jared Weitz

3. Better Organization

A great overlooked benefit to online banking is how it helps you organize your finances. The convenience of having your account at your fingertips pairs with the opportunity to view all your transactions in one easy place. You can monitor where your money goes, stay on top of bills and even set up recurring payments. It’s a perk that is definitely overlooked. -

Greg Herlean

,

Horizon Trust

4. Worldwide Access

The days of having to call your bank or wait for a paper statement in order to check your balance or see what has cleared already are gone. You can now just log in from almost anywhere in the world to check account balances, verify payment or confirm a check has cleared. The sheer level of convenience of this alone makes it well worth learning how to use online banking for business. -

Danielle Kunkle Roberts

Boomer Benefits

5. No Branches, No Paperwork

Done right, online small business banking has the potential to vastly improve business back-office productivity. The impact can be tremendous. No more waiting in line at branches. No faxing forms. No customer service hold. Watch out though! Many banks have created online banking portals that still pull business owners into branches or keep them on hold. Look for native digital offerings instead. -

Eytan Bensoussan

,

NorthOne

6. Fraud Alerts

Online banking allows you to see your transactions in real-time, and if something seems off, your bank will alert you. If your bank sees a history of debit card transactions from one location, then all of a sudden a Match.com purchase from halfway across the country pops up, that will trigger a red flag. That kind of security is invaluable. -

Jeff Pitta

,

Medicare Plan Finder

7. Easy Tracking

Online banking offers you an easy-to-follow audit trail. When you opt to use bill pay in online banking, tracking your incomes and outflows is effortless. I love online banking at tax time for recovering not only business expense details, but also tracking down personal expenses for tax preparation. -

Justin Goodbread

,

Heritage Investors

8. Mobile Check Deposit

One of my favorite features is the mobile check deposit. At first, mobile banking was great because you could quickly see your account balance, statements, message center, order checks, apply for a loan, order a replacement card, etc. You can even turn your debit cards on and off on-demand for security. Now, you can take a picture of your check and deposit it through your bank's mobile app. -

David Haass

,

Elite Insurance Partners, LLC

9. Easier Vendor Payments

One overlooked feature is business bill pay. Why waste time writing and mailing a check? Who has time for that anyway when you are always on the go. A simple setup in your bank's bill pay and a check is mailed directly to your vendor, and as an added bonus, the check is certified funds. Alternatively, you can ACH the payment if it's an ongoing relationship -- even businesses like direct deposit. -

Mobile Payments vs. Credit Card Payments

Posted: July 2, 2021 | Updated: July 2, 2021

Mobile payments have never been more popular. People are using mobile payments these days to complete quick transactions through their mobile devices. You’ll notice a few distinct differences when looking at mobile and

credit card payments

. Many of these entail the technologies used and how people may find mobile payments to be more useful for their needs.

The Concept of a Mobile Payment

A mobile payment entails a transaction made through a mobile device. The customer can use a smartphone, smartwatch, or even a wristband.

The user will pay for something with a mobile payment solution like Apple Pay or Google Pay. The system incorporates credit card or bank data in one platform. The user will transmit one’s payment information from that account to the retailer to complete the purchase.

Each

mobile payment

comes from a digital wallet. The wallet will link to an appropriate interface or platform. The wallet will include the bank or card info. The mobile payment system takes the payment info from the digital wallet and uses it to cover the transaction. Some digital wallets like what PayPal uses can include specific amounts of money someone withdraws from a bank or credit line before spending that total.

The system simplifies how people can pay for their purchases. Customers don’t have to get a physical credit card out to complete a transaction. The buyer will have more control over the purchase experience, especially as that person can handle the payment in less time. The customer may also feel more comfortable with the transaction process when using a mobile payment system.

A Safer Solution

One difference between mobile payments and credit card deals is that mobile transactions are safer. A mobile payment can help the customer send data from a digital wallet to the retailer, completing the transaction without providing any cards. The mobile payment system ensures full security over a deal.

You won’t see that same security with a credit card. Although credit cards have evolved to feature a chip-based system that is harder to hack, there is always the potential for someone to steal a card. A person can always steal a card or its identifying numbers and use it to commit fraud.

But with a mobile transaction, the thief would have to use a thumbprint scan or other system to confirm one’s identity. It would be tough for that person to try and duplicate that thumbprint in this process. Many mobile devices are also locked through PINs or other biometric features, so that adds extra security to the deal.

How People Get These Systems

People will apply for credit cards by filling out the proper forms for getting them ready. People will submit credit info to highlight their ability to pay their balances. Some people may be rejected for cards if they have poor credit ratings. The ones that do get accepted may be subject to high interest rates and restrictive charges.

A mobile payment is different, as a customer will require a suitable payment app on one’s device. Google Pay and Apple Pay are the most prominent apps, although Samsung Pay is available on many Samsung devices. The user will link one’s existing bank or card info to the app. The system is simple and gives the customer more power over how one will pay for items.

Since people don’t need credit to get a mobile payment account, you can expect these payments to be more common. People prefer payment choices that don’t require lots of effort or risk. Some of these payments will entail direct bank transfers, making the transaction process easier to follow.

Convenience For the Customer

Customers also use mobile transactions because they are more convenient:

There’s no need for the customer to keep lots of cards on hand. The customer’s payment info is all on the same mobile payment app.

It takes less time to complete a mobile payment than it does to run a credit card.

It is easier to track a phone or other smart device if it gets lost than if one’s credit card was lost.

Mobile payment platforms can inform customers of whatever coupons or other discounts they have stored with them. They will not forget about these like they would if they had traditional coupons they would use with a credit card.

What Systems Accept These?

One difference between mobile payments and credit cards entails the point of sale or POS systems that can accept these choices. Most POS setups can accept credit cards, with the technology being so common.

But not all platforms can accept mobile payments. A

POS system

must support a system like Google Pay or Apple Pay to complete mobile payments. A POS setup can also work with different integrations with systems like PayPal, Venmo, or anything else a customer wants to use.

The extra effort necessary for accepting mobile payments makes it tough for some retailers to support them. As more people start using mobile payments and the technology becomes more commonplace, you can expect to find more POS solutions that can support mobile deals.

Will Mobile Payments Take Over?

It is possible that mobile payments will become more popular than credit cards after a while. It will take a long time before anyone can figure out what will happen.

The problem with mobile payments is that many people are uncertain about how they work. They also might not have the mobile devices necessary to complete these payments. Some are also comfortable with credit cards, especially since chip-based ones are more secure than older magstripe models.

You can expect mobile payments to become more prominent, especially as mobile devices become more accessible. Potential advances in payment technology will also help increase the chances for these payments to be popular and useful among people. Whatever happens it will be exciting for people to see as they look at how payment trends change and people start to see what’s more efficient and effective.

Fintech & Payment Trends

Mobile payments are fueling a lifestyle and eCommerce revolution – is your company ready?

Every day, shoppers around the world are choosing to pay for their items with mobile devices in their hands instead of the cash and credit cards in their wallets. This is all thanks to improved technology, better connectivity and superior all-around convenience. As such, local payments made via mobile devices are experiencing dramatic growth worldwide with no signs of slowing.

Chinese payment app

AliPay

has over a billion users (eMarketer).

By 2024, the predicted mobile payment market size is estimated to reach 3 trillion (EmizenTech)

From 2020 to 2025, mobile payments use will continue to rise at 27% of CAGR (EmizenTech)

Over 1/3 of the global population will adopt a mobile wallet by 2024 (The Paypers)

Sustained growth means that mobile-based payments aren’t just a fad or trend, they are a lifestyle and eCommerce revolution that merchants must harness to succeed.

Three Types of Mobile Payments Commonly Used by Global Consumers

Mobile Point of Sale

Growing in popularity around the world, mobile point of sale replaces a fixed POS terminal with a phone or tablet and uses special hardware to allow for payment via credit or debit card.

Remote Mobile Payments

Whether it’s on an app like Amazon or a website like Nike.com, you are conducting a remote mobile payment whenever you purchase something via your mobile device.

Mobile Proximity Payments

Similar to mobile point-of-sale, mobile proximity payments are any transactions that occur at a point of sale where shoppers use a mobile device to pay in place of credit cards or cash. These transactions are useful for stores to accept mobile payments.

However, mobile proximity payments are incredibly convenient for shoppers because they only require a simple wave, tap or scan of a QR code from a mobile device to complete payment.

GrabPay

and AliPay are popular digital wallets that enable mobile proximity payments.

Digital Wallets Are Replacing Traditional Ones

As more shoppers rely on their phones to make purchases, they are reaching into their wallets less often. With that trend comes the rise of digital wallets, a preferred local payment method for both remote mobile payments and mobile proximity payments.

Also known as ewallets, digital wallets securely store shoppers’ payment details like credit card or bank information from the convenience of their smartphone. Some ewallets can also be topped up via cash deposits at retail locations and kiosks, eliminating the need for a bank or credit card. This allows customers to easily make in-person cashless and cardless payments thanks to Near Field Communication technology (NFC) and Quick Response codes (QR codes).

NFC Mobile Payments:

Available in most smartphones today, NFC payments technology allows shoppers to simply scan, wave or tap their phone near the POS system to complete payment. The transaction is fast, contactless and uses a shopper’s digital wallet instead of cash, credit card or check.

QR Codes:

As an easily identifiable matrix barcode, QR codes allow shoppers to use their smartphone camera to quickly authenticate and authorize a payment from their digital wallet during a point of sale transaction. This technology is currently dominating payments in Asia and predictions for the future of mobile payments throughout the world, due to its low cost and widespread accessibility.

The Types of Mobile Payment Wallets

Just like regular wallets,

mobile wallets

come in all shapes and sizes, each boasting various features and reasons to use them. Today, there are two types of digital wallets growing in popularity across the world: closed-loop wallets and open-loop wallets

Closed-Loop Wallet:

Anyone who uses their Starbucks app to purchase their morning coffee is using a closed-loop wallet. Offered by retailers to increase loyalty, offer discounts and learn more about their shoppers, closed-loop wallets are a popular way to pay for items only at a particular store.

Open-Loop Wallet:

This type of digital wallet works more like a traditional wallet by storing bank and credit information and allowing shoppers to use it wherever it’s an accepted form of payment. GrabPay, Paytm and AliPay are all prevalent examples of digital wallet platforms.

List of Top Mobile Payment Apps by Region

Around the globe, there are hundreds of solutions to help consumers ease the payment process. Thanks to the ever-growing market, accepting mobile payments has never been easier no matter where you are.

Top Payment Apps in Asia

In Asia,

AliPay

and WeChat Pay lead the charge in payment technology. Together, they account for

90% of the mobile wallet market share in China

, which highlights the dominance of these two many Asian markets (Asia Pacific Foundation). WeChat Pay boasts over

1 billion active users

, while AliPay exceeds that amount at 1.3 billion active accounts.

In India, the

Paytm ewallet

processed over 1 billion monthly transactions and holds a greater customer base than credit cards (TechCrunch). The

GrabPay superapp

and Grab wallet are also widely used in Southeast Asian areas, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

Top Payment Apps in the

Americas

In the Americas, competition for the top payment app is more fiercely contested. It’s no secret that

Paypal

is an established payment app, with over

360 million users

worldwide. However,

Apple Pay

and Google Pay are also incredibly popular mobile payment apps in North America.

Latin America is the fastest-growing region for mobile payments, and Paypal’s reach in this region doesn’t match up to its US and Canadian success.

Mercado Pago and PagSeguro

are some of the most

beloved payment apps in the region

, largely due to their affordable fees.

Top Payment Apps in Europe, Middle East and Africa

In Europe, the Middle East and Africa mobile payments users have a varied range of opinions by country, with no standout winner in terms of payment app popularity. In Europe, Swedes prefer to opt for

Buy Now, Pay Later

app Klarna, whereas Russians prefer Yoomoney and

most Germans use Paypal

.

The Middle East bucks many of the payment trends seen elsewhere. Despite widespread smartphone usage of

80-90%

, this area has been slower to adopt mobile payment methods, with cash largely remaining on top. However, digital payments increased during the pandemic, and Paypal and Samsung Pay and local payment apps like

Careem Pay have gained in popularity (Mordor Intelligence).

M-PESA is Africa’s premier payment service

in Africa, with over 51 million users across 7 countries (Vodaphone). Still, emerging options such as Samsung Pay are also gaining ground with

3 million transactions

in

South Africa

(Samsung Newsroom).

Implementing Mobile Solutions for Payment Increases Conversion Rates

Although mobile payments are the most common method for transactions around the world, research indicates that checkout abandonment rates are twice as likely to occur from a mobile shopper than a desktop shopper, which is why it’s critical you get mobile payments right (Montate).

By integrating with a mobile payment gateway that accepts payments like local digital wallets, you’re offering shoppers a fast, familiar, and convenient payment methods they know and trust.

Merchants Must Adopt Mobile Payments or Be Left Behind

While it is likely that cash will not disappear completely for 25 years or more, our transition towards a cashless society has only been expedited, with some countries now having only minimal cash usage.

Physical card payments are likely to lose significant ground to mobile and digital payments over the next ten years (Gartner). Shoppers no longer need to carry around a physical purse or wallet when their smartphone can unlock all their payment needs.

By 2027, experts predict the digital payments market to increase in value to almost

$13 trillion

, and mobile payments are set to be a key part of this revolution.  By offering mobile-friendly digital wallet payment options alongside card acceptance in both your point of sale and ecommerce checkout, your company can stay ahead of the curve today and well into the future.
