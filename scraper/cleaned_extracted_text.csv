Economic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Consistent in their release wide in their scope and range metrics such as the Consumer Price Index DPI and written reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. Policymakers most notably those at the Federal Reserve use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going but how fast it's getting there. Although investors should get to know economic indicators the reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw. In other words, information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and asset allocation. But there is valuable information in those raw data releases. The various government and non-profit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns both of which can be very useful to individual investors. There are also indexes for coincident indicators and lagging indicators. For example, are increasing retail sales figures being validated by increased personal expenditures? Are new factory orders leading to higher factory shipments and higher durable goods figures? Are higher wages showing up in higher personal income figures? The savvy investor will look up and down the supply chain to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release. Personalizing Your Research, some people may prefer to understand a couple of specific indicators really well and use this expert knowledge to make investment plays based on their analyses. Others may wish to adopt a jack-of-all-trades approach, understanding the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. For example, a retired couple living on a combination of pensions and long-term Treasury bonds should be looking for different things than a stock trader who rides the waves of the business cycle. Most investors fall in the middle, hoping for stock market returns to be steady and near long-term historical averages about 8 to 10 per year. Knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful as well as generally knowing the macroeconomic forecasts. On the day a specific indicator release is made there will be press releases from news wires such as the Associated Press and Reuters. It is helpful to read a report on one of the newswires which may parse the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations, seasonality figures, and year-over-year results. For those that use investment advisors, these individuals will probably analyze recently released indicators in an upcoming newsletter or discuss them during upcoming meetings. Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure. The most notable in this group are the Producer Price Index PPI and the Consumer Price Index CPI. Many investors will use the PPI to try and predict the upcoming CPI. Each index is derived independently but both are released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS. The gross domestic product GDP may be the most important indicator out there, especially to equity investors who are focused on corporate profit growth. Since the GDP represents the sum of what our economy is producing, its growth rate is targeted to be in certain ranges. If the numbers start to fall outside those ranges, fear of inflation or recession will grow in the markets. To get ahead of this fear, many people will follow the monthly indicators that can shed some light on the quarterly GDP report. Metrics such as wholesale inventories, the Beige Book, the Purchasing Managers Index PMI and the labor report all shed light on how well our economy is functioning. By the time the actual GDP report is released there will be a general consensus of the figure that is remarkably accurate. If the actual results deviate much from the estimates the markets will move, often with high volatility. If the number falls right into the middle of the expected range then the markets and investors can collectively pat themselves on the back and let prevailing investing trends continue. Over all, asset allocation decisions can fluctuate over time and making such changes after a monthly review of macro indicators may be wise. The Bottom Line, Benchmark pieces of economic indicator data arrive with no agenda or sales pitch. The data just is and that is hard to find these days. By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the stock market and the economy in which their dollars are invested and they can also be better prepared to revisit an investment thesis when the timing is right. Using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter portfolio management for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor.

1,1,"""""""PricingStrategyDifferentMarketStructures. Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate. 

Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. The supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are mere price takers and operate as long as production costs fall below revenue.

Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy: In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products.  

Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy: Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. A company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. Competition is based on product differentiation and services but not on price wars.

Monopoly Market Structure: The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior in favor of substitute products. 

Question: In monopolistic competitive markets, firms A. are price takers B. react to the prices set by competitors or C. set their own prices. 
Solution: The correct answer is C. In monopolistic competition, a firm won't be affected by another firm's strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.""""""",https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/economics/describe-pricing-strategy-under-each-market-structure/
