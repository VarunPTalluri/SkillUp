What Is an Economic Indicator?
An economic indicator is a piece of economic data, usually of
macroeconomic
scale, that is used by analysts to interpret current or future investment possibilities. These indicators also help to judge the overall health of an economy. Economic indicators can be anything the investor chooses, but specific pieces of data released by the government and non-profit organizations have become widely followed. Such indicators include but aren't limited to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
,
gross domestic product
(GDP), or unemployment figures.
Key Takeaways
An economic indicator is a macroeconomic measurement used by analysts to understand current and future economic activity and opportunity.
The most widely-used economic indicators come from data released by the government and non-profit organizations or universities.
Indicators can be leading—which tend to precede trends, lagging—which confirm trends, or coincident—that which is happening now.
Indicators can also be lagging, which means they report economic circumstances but only after the circumstance has materialized.
Indicators can give investors insight as to how trades may play out, though unreliability of data and inconsistence of variables may yield indicators less helpful.

Types of Economic Indicators
Economic indicators can be divided into categories or groups. Most of these economic indicators have a specific schedule for release, allowing
investors
to prepare for and plan on seeing certain information at certain times of the month and year.
Leading Indicators
Leading indicators
, such as the yield curve, consumer durables, net business formations, and share prices, are used to predict the future movements of an economy. The numbers or data on these financial guideposts will move or change before the economy, thus their category's name. Consideration of the information from these indicators must be taken with a grain of salt, as they can be incorrect.
Investors are most often interested in leading indicators, as a correctly placed leading indicator means certain measures correctly predicted the future. Leading indicators are prepared making broad economic assumptions. For example, many investors track forward-looking yield curves to project how future interest rates may dictate stock or bond performance. This analysis relies on historical data; based on how investments performed the last time the yield curve was a certain way, some may assume those same investments will repeat their performance.
Coincident Indicators
Coincident indicators
, which include such things as GDP, employment levels, and retail sales, are seen with the occurrence of specific economic activities. This class of metrics shows the activity of a particular area or region. Many policymakers and economists follow this real-time data, as it provides the most insight into to what is actually happening. These types of indicators also allow for policymakers to leverage real data without delay to make informed decisions.
Coincident indicators are somewhat less helpful to investors, as the economic situation has already blossomed. As opposed to a forecast or a prediction, a coincident indicator informs investors of what is actually happening in the present. Therefore coincident indicators are only useful to those who can correctly interpret how economic conditions today (i.e. falling GDP) will impact future periods.
Lagging Indicators
Lagging indicators
, such as gross national product (GNP), CPI, unemployment rates, and interest rates, are only seen after a specific economic activity occurs. As the name implies, these data sets show information after the event has happened. This trailing indicator is a technical indicator that comes after large economic shifts.
The problem with lagging indicators is the strategy or response to these indicators may be too late. For example, by the time the Federal Reserve interprets CPI data and decides how best to enact monetary policy to stem inflation, the numbers they are observing are slightly outdated. Though lagging indicators are still used by many governments and institutions, they also pose the risk of guiding incorrect decision-making due to incorrect assumptions about present-day economics.
Indicators provide signs along the road, but the best investors utilize many economic indicators, combining them to glean insight into patterns and verifications within multiple sets of data.
Interpreting Economic Indicators
An economic indicator is only useful if one interprets it correctly. History has shown strong
correlations
between
economic growth
, as measured by GDP, and corporate profit growth. However, determining whether a specific company may grow its earnings based on one indicator of GDP is nearly impossible.
There is no denying the objective importance of interest rates, gross domestic product, and existing home sales or other indexes. Why objectively important? Because what you're really measuring is the cost of money, spending, investment, and the activity level of a major portion of the overall economy.
Like many other forms of financial or economic metrics, economic indicators hold tremendous value when compared across a period of time. For example, governments may observe how unemployment rates have fluctuated over the past five years. A single instance of unemployment rates doesn't yield much value; however, comparing it to prior periods allows analysts to better gauge a statistic.
In addition, many economic indicators have a benchmark set, whether by a government agency or other entity. Consider how the Federal Reserve's target rate of inflation is usually 2%. The Federal Reserve then enacts policies based on CPI measurements to achieve this target. Without this benchmark, analysts and policymakers wouldn't know what makes a good indicator's value good or poor.
The Stock Market As an Indicator
Leading indicators forecast where an economy is headed. One of the top leading indicators is the stock market itself. Though not the most critical leading indicator, it’s the one that most people look at. Because stock prices factor in forward-looking performance, the market can indicate the economy’s direction, if earnings estimates are accurate.
A strong market may suggest that earnings estimates are up, which may suggest overall economic activity is up. Conversely, a down market may indicate that company earnings are expected to suffer. However, there are limitations to the usefulness of the stock market as an indicator because performance to estimates is not guaranteed, so there is a risk.
Also, stocks are subject to price manipulations caused by Wall Street traders and corporations. Manipulations can include inflating stock prices via high-volume trades, complex financial derivative strategies and creative accounting principles—both legal and illegal. The stock market is also vulnerable to the emergence of “bubbles,” which may give a false positive regarding the market’s direction.
If you're particularly interested in a specific economic indicator released monthly by the government, be aware that report is often released on the same day (i.e. second Tuesday) of every month at the same time.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Economic Indicators
Pros of Economic Indicators
Economic indicators rely on data to substantiate predictions of what is to come in the future. When analyzed correctly, investors can capitalize on data to make successful trades or correctly assess future market conditions.
Economic indicators are often free and public, as the United States government prepares many economic indicators. In addition, these economic indicators reported by governments often have a fixed cadence and steady form of measurement. This means you can usually rely on the method of how an indicator was calculated and the timing of when that indicator will be released.
Cons of Economic Indicators
The obvious downside to economic indicators, at least leading or coincident indicators, is that they rely on some degree of forecasting. While leading indicators are projections to the future, even coincident indicators may rely on a bit of assumptions. Therefore, economic indicators do not always predict the future correctly, and the recommended action to take may not play out as expected.
Economic indicators, though boiled down to a single number, can be very complex. For example, consider all of the variables the comprise unemployment. From macroeconomic conditions to weather patterns impacting farming jobs, there may be too many levers that manipulate a given indicator that make it tough to accurately predict what will happen.
Finally, economic indicators are somewhat open to interpretation. Consider an example where inflation has dropped from 4.6% to 4.5%. Is this considered a good change, or should the drop have been larger? Economics and policymakers often debate on the appropriate approach for economic factors. Though data may be concrete, the way to interpret it may lead to various ways evaluating these indicators.
Economic Indicators Pros and Cons
Pros
May accurately forecast what is to come based on prevailing data
Often use publicly available information
May be calculated using the same process over and over (when issued by governments)
May be released on a fixed, predictable cadence
Cons
May not accurately predict the future
Relies on many assumptions, some of which may be unpredictable
Can be open for interpretation, as data may indicate different things
Still requires expertise to interpret and understand the results
What Is the Most Important Economic Indicator?
Every economist may come up with their own favorite economic indicator. For many, a country's GDP usually represents the best overall picture of a country's economic health. It combines the monetary value of every produced in an economy for a certain period, and it considers household consumption, government purchases, and imports/exports.
Is Inflation an Economic Indicator?
Yes, inflation is a lagging indicator that is reported after a rise in prices has occurred. This type of economic indicator is helpful for government agencies to set public policy, as without this type of data, they would not know the direction of the economy. Therefore, while inflation and other lagging indicators are still useful to investors, they are more useful not for the indicator themselves (as they are representative of the past) but for future policy responses.
What Are the Economic Indicators of a Strong Economy?
An economy may be strong if it has a robust amount of economic activity, and job growth. This is measured by low unemployment, steady inflation, increases to construction, positive consumer index readings, and increasing GDP.
Do Traders Use Economic Indicators?
Traders and investment professionals may use economic indicators to predict how broad economic policy will impact their trades or investment strategy. Many trades rely on technical indicators which reflect the detailed movement of specific stocks. Technical indicators are different than economic indicators as economic indicators are much more broad and less security-specific.
The Bottom Line
Economic indicators are leading, coincident, or lagging figures that indicate broad conditions. Economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, inflation, or certain prices inform economics, companies, and investors of not only where the economy is today but perhaps where the economy may be headed. Economic indicators can be used to guide government policy or set investment strategies.

Economic indicators
are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Consistent in their release, wide in their scope and range, metrics such as the
Consumer Price Index
(CPI) and written reports like the
Beige Book
are free for all investors to inspect and analyze.
Policymakers, most notably those at the
Federal Reserve
, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going, but how fast it's getting there.
Although investors should get to know economic indicators, the reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw. In other words, information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and
asset allocation
. But there is valuable information in those raw data releases. The various government and nonprofit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, both of which can be very useful to individual investors.
What Is an Economic Indicator?
In its simplest form, an indicator could be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. The U.S. economy is essentially a living thing where, at any given moment, there are billions of moving parts—some acting, others reacting. This simple truth makes predictions extremely difficult. They must always involve a large number of assumptions, no matter what resources are put to the task. But with the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various
economic conditions
. There are also indexes for
coincident indicators
and
lagging indicators
—the components of each are based on whether they tend to rise during or after an economic expansion.﻿
Use in Tandem, Use in Context
Once an investor understands how various indicators are calculated and their
relative strengths
and limitations, several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. For example, in the area of employment, consider using data from several releases. By using the hours-worked data (from the
Employment Cost Index
) along with the
labor report
and
nonfarm payrolls
, investors can get a fairly complete picture of the state of the
labor market
.
Additionally, are increasing retail sales figures being validated by increased personal expenditures? Are new
factory orders
leading to higher factory shipments and higher
durable goods
figures? Are higher wages showing up in higher
personal income
figures? The savvy investor will look up and down the
supply chain
to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release.
Personalizing Your Research
Some people may prefer to understand a couple of specific indicators really well and use this expert knowledge to make investment plays based on their analyses. Others may wish to adopt a jack-of-all-trades approach, understanding the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. For example, a retired couple living on a combination of
pensions
and long-term
Treasury bonds
should be looking for different things than a
stock trader
who rides the waves of the
business cycle
. Most investors fall in the middle, hoping for stock market returns to be steady and near long-term historical averages (about 8% to 10% per year).
Knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful, as well as generally knowing the
macroeconomic
forecasts. Forecast numbers can be found at several public websites, such as Yahoo! Finance or MarketWatch. On the day a specific indicator release is made, there will be
press releases
from newswires such as the Associated Press and Reuters, which will present figures with key pieces highlighted.
It is helpful to read a report on one of the newswires, which may parse the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations,
seasonality
figures, and year-over-year results. For those that use
investment advisors
, these individuals will probably analyze recently released indicators in an upcoming newsletter or discuss them during upcoming meetings.
Inflation Indicators: Keeping a Watchful Eye
Many investors, especially those who invest primarily in
fixed-income securities
, are concerned about
inflation
. Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure. The most notable in this group are the
Producer Price Index
(PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
﻿
﻿﻿ Many investors will use the PPI to try and predict the upcoming CPI.
There is a proven statistical relationship between the two, as economic theory suggests that if producers of goods are forced to pay more in production, some portion of the price increase will be passed on to consumers. Each index is derived independently, but both are released by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS). Other key inflationary indicators include the levels and
growth rates
of the
money supply
and the Employment Cost Index (ECI).
﻿
﻿﻿﻿
﻿
﻿﻿
Economic Output: Stock Investors Inquire Within
The
gross domestic product
(GDP) may be the most important indicator out there, especially to equity investors who are focused on
corporate profit
growth. Since the GDP represents the sum of what our economy is producing, its growth rate is targeted to be in certain ranges. If the numbers start to fall outside those ranges, fear of inflation or
recession
will grow in the markets. To get ahead of this fear, many people will follow the monthly indicators that can shed some light on the quarterly GDP report.
For example,
capital goods
shipments from the
Factory Orders Report
are used to calculate producers' durable equipment orders within the GDP report.
Indicators such as
retail sales
and
current account
balances are also used in the computations of GDP, so their release helps to complete part of the economic puzzle prior to the quarterly GDP release.
Other indicators that aren't part of the actual calculations for GDP are still valuable for their predictive abilities. Metrics such as wholesale inventories, the Beige Book, the
Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI), and the labor report all shed light on how well our economy is functioning. With the assistance of all these monthly data, GDP estimates will begin to tighten up as the component data slowly gets released throughout the quarter. By the time the actual GDP report is released, there will be a general consensus of the figure that is remarkably accurate. If the actual results deviate much from the estimates, the markets will move, often with high
volatility
. If the number falls right into the middle of the expected range, then the markets and investors can collectively pat themselves on the back and let prevailing investing trends continue.
Mark Your Calendar
Sometimes indicators take on a more valuable role because they contain very timely data. The
Institute for Supply Management's
PMI report, for instance, is typically released on the first
business day
of every month.
﻿
﻿﻿ As such, it is one of the first pieces of aggregate data available for the month that just ended. While not as rich in detail as many of the indicators to follow, the category breakdowns are often picked apart for clues to things such as future labor report details (from the employment survey results) or wholesale inventories (inventory survey).
The relative order in which the indicators are presented does not change month to month, so investors may want to mark a few days on their monthly calendars to read up on the areas of the economy that might change how they think about their investments or
time horizon
.
﻿
﻿﻿ Overall, asset allocation decisions can fluctuate over time, and making such changes after a monthly review of macro indicators may be wise.
The Bottom Line
Benchmark pieces of economic indicator data arrive with no agenda or sales pitch. The data just
is,
and that is hard to find these days. By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the
stock market
and the economy in which their dollars are invested, and they can also be better prepared to revisit an
investment thesis
when the timing is right. While there is no one ""magic indicator"" that can dictate whether to buy or sell, using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter
portfolio management
for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor.

What Are Financial Markets?
Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs, including the stock market, bond market, forex market, and derivatives market. Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies.
Key Takeaways
Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs.
There are many kinds of financial markets, including (but not limited to) forex, money, stock, and bond markets.
These markets may include assets or securities that are either listed on regulated exchanges or trade over-the-counter (OTC).
Financial markets trade in all types of securities and are critical to the smooth operation of a capitalist society.
When financial markets fail, economic disruption, including recession and rising unemployment, can result.
Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi
Understanding the Financial Markets
Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of
capitalist economies
by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs. The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings. Financial markets create securities products that provide a return for those with excess funds (investors/lenders) and make these funds available to those needing additional money (borrowers).
The stock market is just one type of financial market. Financial markets are created when people buy and sell financial instruments, including equities, bonds, currencies, and derivatives. Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate.
Some financial markets are small with little activity, and others, like the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
, trade trillions of dollars in securities daily. The equities (stock) market is a financial market that enables investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. The primary stock market is where new issues of stocks are sold. Any subsequent trading of stocks occurs in the secondary market, where investors buy and sell securities they already own.
Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value.
Types of Financial Markets
There are several different types of markets. Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it.
Stock Markets
Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets. These are venues where companies list their shares, which are bought and sold by traders and investors. Stock markets, or equities markets, are used by companies to raise capital and by investors to search for returns.
Stocks may be traded on listed exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
Nasdaq
, or the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Most stock trading is done via regulated exchanges, which plays an important economic role because it is another way for money to flow through the economy.
Typical participants in a stock market include (both retail and institutional) investors, traders,
market makers (MMs)
, and specialists who maintain liquidity and provide two-sided markets.
Brokers
are third parties that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers but who do not take an actual position in a stock.
Over-the-Counter Markets
An
over-the-counter (OTC)
market is a decentralized market—meaning it does not have physical locations, and trading is conducted electronically—in which market participants trade securities directly (meaning without a broker). While OTC markets may handle trading in certain stocks (e.g., smaller or riskier companies that do not meet the listing criteria of exchanges), most stock trading is done via exchanges. Certain derivatives markets, however, are exclusively OTC, making up an essential segment of the financial markets. Broadly speaking, OTC markets and the transactions that occur in them are far less regulated, less liquid, and more opaque.
Bond Markets
A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate. You may think of a bond as an agreement between the lender and borrower containing the loan's details and its payments. Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. For example, the bond market sells securities such as notes and bills issued by the United States Treasury. The bond market is also called the debt, credit, or fixed-income market.
Money Markets
Typically, the money markets trade in products with highly liquid short-term maturities (less than one year) and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets.
At the wholesale level, the money markets involve large-volume trades between institutions and traders. At the retail level, they include money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers. Individuals may also invest in the money markets by purchasing short-term
certificates of deposit (CDs)
,
municipal notes
, or U.S. Treasury bills, among other examples.
Derivatives Markets
A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). Rather than trading stocks directly, a derivatives market trades in futures and
options
contracts and other advanced financial products that derive their value from underlying instruments like bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes, and stocks.
Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded. Unlike forwards, which trade OTC, futures markets utilize standardized contract specifications, are well-regulated, and use clearinghouses to settle and confirm trades. Options markets, such as the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe)
, similarly list and regulate options contracts. Both futures and options exchanges may list contracts on various asset classes, such as equities, fixed-income securities, commodities, and so on.
Forex Market
The
forex (foreign exchange) market
is where participants can buy, sell, hedge, and speculate on the exchange rates between
currency pairs
. The forex market is the most liquid market in the world, as cash is the most liquid of assets. The currency market handles more than $7.5 trillion in daily transactions, more than the futures and equity markets combined.
As with the OTC markets, the forex market is also decentralized and consists of a global network of computers and brokers worldwide. The forex market is made up of banks, commercial companies, central banks, investment management firms, hedge funds, and retail forex brokers and investors.
Commodities Markets
Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as agricultural products (e.g., corn, livestock, soybeans), energy products (oil, gas, carbon credits), precious metals (gold, silver, platinum), or
""soft"" commodities
(such as cotton, coffee, and sugar). These are known as
spot commodity
markets, where physical goods are exchanged for money.
However, the bulk of trading in these commodities takes place on derivatives markets that utilize spot commodities as the underlying assets. Forwards, futures, and options on commodities are exchanged both OTC and on listed
exchanges
around the world, such as the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
and the
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
.
Cryptocurrency Markets
Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online
crypto exchanges
. These exchanges host digital wallets for traders to swap one cryptocurrency for another or for fiat monies such as dollars or euros.
Because most crypto exchanges are
centralized
platforms, users are susceptible to hacks or fraudulent activity. Decentralized exchanges are also available that operate without any central authority. These exchanges allow direct peer-to-peer (P2P) trading without an actual exchange authority to facilitate the transactions. Futures and options trading are also available on major cryptocurrencies.
Examples of Financial Markets
The above sections make clear that the ""financial markets"" are broad in scope and scale. To give two more concrete examples, we will consider the role of stock markets in bringing a company to IPO and the role of the OTC derivatives market in the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Stock Markets and IPOs
As a company establishes itself over time and grows, it needs access to additional capital. It will often find itself in need of much larger amounts of capital than it can get from ongoing operations, traditional bank loans, or venture and angel funding. Firms can raise the amount of capital they need by selling shares of itself to the public through an initial public offering (IPO). This changes the company's status from a ""private"" firm whose shares are held by a few shareholders to a
publicly traded
company whose shares will be subsequently held by public investors.
The IPO also offers early investors in the company an opportunity to cash out part of their stake, often reaping very handsome rewards in the process. Initially, the underwriters usually set the IPO price through their pre-marketing process.
Once the company's shares are listed on a
stock exchange
, and trading commences, the price of these shares will fluctuate as investors and traders assess and reassess their intrinsic value and the supply and demand for those shares at any given moment.
OTC Derivatives and the 2008 Financial Crisis: MBS and CDOs
While the 2008-09 financial crisis was caused and made worse by several factors, one factor that has been widely identified is the market for
mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
.
These are OTC derivatives where cash flows from individual mortgages are bundled, sliced up, and sold to investors. The crisis resulted from a sequence of events, each with its own trigger—these events culminated in the banking system's near-collapse. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income consumers, creating a market for
subprime mortgages
.
The amount of subprime mortgage debt guaranteed by
Freddie Mac
and
Fannie Mae
continued to expand into the early 2000s when the Federal Reserve Board began to cut interest rates drastically to avoid a recession.
The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money spurred a housing boom, which drove speculation, pushing up housing prices and creating a real estate bubble. In the meantime, the investment banks, looking for easy profits in the wake of the
dotcom bust
and the 2001 recession, created a type of MBS called
collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market.
Because subprime mortgages were bundled with prime mortgages, there was no way for investors to understand the risks associated with the product. When the market for CDOs began to heat up, the housing bubble that had been building for several years finally burst. As housing prices fell, subprime borrowers began to default on loans that were worth more than their homes, accelerating the decline in prices.
When investors realized the MBS and CDOs were worthless due to the toxic debt they represented, they attempted to unload the obligations. However, there was no market for the CDOs. The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures created liquidity
contagion
that reached the upper tiers of the banking system. Two major investment banks, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, collapsed under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt, and more than 450 banks failed over the next five years.
Several major banks were on the brink of failure and were rescued by a taxpayer-funded bailout.
What Are the Different Types of Financial Markets?
Some examples of financial markets and their roles include the stock market, the bond market, forex, commodities, and the real estate market, among others. Financial markets can also be broken down into capital markets, money markets, primary vs. secondary markets, and listed vs. OTC markets.
How Do Financial Markets Work?
Despite covering many different asset classes and having various structures and regulations, all financial markets work essentially by bringing together buyers and sellers in some asset or contract and allowing them to trade with one another. This is often done through an auction or
price-discovery
mechanism.
What Are the Main Functions of Financial Markets?
Financial markets exist for several reasons, but the most fundamental function is to allow for the efficient allocation of capital and assets in a financial economy. By allowing a free market for the flow of capital, financial obligations, and money, the financial markets make the global economy run more smoothly while allowing investors to participate in capital gains over time.
The Bottom Line
Financial markets provide liquidity, capital, and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability. Without financial markets, capital could not be allocated efficiently, and economic activity such as commerce and trade, investments, and growth opportunities would be greatly diminished.
Many players make markets an essential part of the economy—firms use stock and bond markets to raise capital from investors. Speculators look to various asset classes to make directional bets on future prices. At the same time,
hedgers
use derivatives markets to mitigate various risks, and
arbitrageurs
seek to take advantage of mispricings or anomalies observed across various markets. Brokers often act as mediators that bring buyers and sellers together, earning a commission or fee for their services.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren popularized the 50/20/30 budget rule in her book,
All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan.
The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings.
This intuitive and straightforward rule can help you draw up a reasonable budget that you can stick to over time in order to meet your financial goals.
Key Takeaways
The rule states that you should spend up to 50% of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do.
The remaining half should be split up between 20% savings and debt repayment and 30% to everything else that you might want.
The rule is a template that is intended to help individuals manage their money and save for emergencies and retirement.
The purpose of the 50/30/20 rule is to balance paying for necessities while being mindful of long-term savings and retirement.
The 50/30/20 rule can be simplified by setting up automatic deposits, using automatic payments, and tracking changes in income.
50%: Needs
Needs are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for survival. Half of your after-tax income should be all that you need to cover your needs and obligations. If you are spending more than that on your needs, you will have to either cut down on wants or try to downsize your lifestyle, perhaps to a smaller home or more modest car. Maybe carpooling or taking public transportation to work is a solution, or cooking at home more often. Examples of ""needs"" include but aren't limited to:
Rent or
mortgage
payments
Car payments
Groceries
Insurance and health care
Minimum debt payments
Utilities
30%: Wants
Wants are all the things you spend money on that are not absolutely essential. Anything in the ""wants"" bucket is optional if you boil it down. You can work out at home instead of going to the gym, cook instead of eating out, or watch sports on TV instead of getting tickets to the game.
This category also includes those upgrade decisions you make, such as choosing a costlier steak instead of a less expensive hamburger, buying a Mercedes instead of a more economical Honda, or choosing between watching television using an antenna for free or spending money to watch cable TV. Basically, wants are all those little extras you spend money on that make life more enjoyable and entertaining. In general, examples of ""wants"" include but aren't limited to:
New unnecessary clothes or accessories like handbags or jewelry
Tickets to sporting events
Vacations or other non-essential travel
The latest electronic gadget (especially an upgrade over a fully functioning prior model)
Ultra-high-speed Internet beyond your streaming needs
20%: Savings
Finally, try to allocate 20% of your net income to savings and investments. You should have at least three months of emergency savings on hand in case you lose your job or an unforeseen event occurs. After that, focus on retirement and meeting other financial goals down the road. Examples of savings could include:
Creating an
emergency fund
Making
IRA contributions
to a
mutual fund
account
Investing in the stock market
Setting aside funds to buy physical property for long-term holding
Making debt repayments beyond minimum payments
If emergency funds are ever used, the first allocation of additional income should be to replenish the emergency fund account.
Importance of Savings
Americans are notoriously bad at saving, and the nation has extremely high levels of debt. As of August 2023, the average personal savings rate for individuals in the United States was just 3.9%.
The 50-20-30 rule is intended to help individuals manage their after-tax income, primarily to have funds on hand for emergencies and savings for
retirement
. Every household should prioritize creating an emergency fund in case of job losses, unexpected medical expenses, or any other unforeseen monetary cost. If an emergency fund is used, then a household should focus on replenishing it.
Saving for retirement is also a critical step as individuals are living longer. Calculating how much you will need for retirement and working towards that goal, beginning at a young age will ensure a comfortable retirement.
Benefits of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule
The 50/30/20 rule can guide individuals to financial prosperity in a number of different ways. Potential benefits from these guidelines include:
Ease of Use:
The 50/30/20 rule offers a straightforward framework for budgeting, making it simple to comprehend and apply. You may distribute your income immediately without the need for intricate calculations. This makes it so even the least financially-savvy person can still adhere to these rules.
Enact Financial Balance:
By using a budget, you may manage your money in a balanced way. You may make sure that your necessary costs are covered, that you have money for
discretionary spending
, and that you're actively saving for the future. In this way, you'll be able to save for the future, save for current needs, and still have a little fun with finances.
Prioritize Vital Expenses:
You can make sure that you cover your fundamental needs without going over budget or taking on too much debt by giving these basics top priority. As these rules stipulate that half of your budget goes towards needs, this plan makes sure your essentials are more likely to be met.
Emphasize Saving Goals:
By allocating 20% of your income to savings, you can set up an emergency fund, prepare for retirement, pay off debt, invest, or pursue other financial goals. By consistently saving this amount, you establish sound financial practices and build a safety net for unforeseen costs or future goals.
Promote Long-Term Financial Security:
Using these rules, you give your financial future priority by continuously setting aside 20% of your salary. This expenditure on savings can help you accumulate money, meet long-term financial objectives, and give yourself and your family a sense of security as you approach retirement in either the short-term or long-term timeframe.
The idea behind the 50/30/20 rule is that anyone can use these proportions, regardless of their income. However, be mindful how those with lower income or those living in higher cost of living areas may need to adjust these percentages.
How to Adopt the 50/30/20 Budget Rule
No single way of tracking to a budget will work for everyone. However, here are some high-level tips on adopting a 50/30/20 budget relevant to all individuals.
Track Your Expenses
To better understand your spending habits, start by keeping track of your expenses for a month or two. Analyze your spending to determine how well it adheres to the 50/30/20 breakdown by classifying it into needs, wants, and savings. This will set the groundwork for better understanding how far off from budget you will be starting off at. Also, the only way you'll know you're being successful at adhering to this budget is by tracking your actual spend. Most often, this can be done fairly easy using spreadsheet solutions such as
Microsoft Excel
.
Understanding Your Income
The basis of the 50/30/20 budget is rooted in understanding what your income is. Take caution that your gross income may be vastly different from your net income as Federal income taxes reduce what you'll take home. By understanding what you earn and what actually hits your bank account each pay period, you'll be better positioned to establish the correct budget amounts for the three categories.
Identify Your Critical Costs
This includes expenses such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, transportation expenses, insurance premiums, and debt repayments. These costs are non-negotiable, and these must be expenses necessary for your daily living. Because these expenses may take up the largest portion of your budget, it's important to be most mindful with this group. In addition, these expenses must be incurred, so you likely have the least amount of flexibility once they are committed to. For example, locking into a
rental agreement
may require a six-month or 12-month requirement.
Automate Your Savings
By automating the process, saving will be simpler. Set up monthly automated payments from your checking account to your investment or savings accounts. This guarantees that your funds increase steadily without requiring manual labor. This may also make it easier to regularly review your budget to make sure it is in line with your lifestyle and financial objectives as there is less of a burden to administratively manage your savings.
Maintain Consistency
Adopting the 50/30/20 budget guideline successfully requires maintaining consistency. Over time, stick to your spending strategy and resisted the want to go over budget or depart from your percentage allocations. Like any other form of budget, this plan is often most successful when there are clear guidelines that can leveraged every month. Be mindful to reset your spending limits each month, and strive to maintain consistency from one period to the next.
Example of the 50/30/20 Budget Rule
Imagine a person recently graduated from college and started her first full-time job. She wants to develop good financial habits from the beginning and has heard about the 50/30/20 budget rule. Eager to take control of her finances, she decides to set up a 50/30/20 budget.
To understand her spending patterns, the person starts tracking her expenses for a month. She uses a budgeting app that categorizes her expenses automatically into needs, wants, and savings. The person calculates her monthly
after-tax income
, which amounts to $3,500. This will be her basis for allocating her budget according to the 50/30/20 rule.
After analyzing her tracked expenses, the person realizes that her essential expenses like rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and student loan payments add up to approximately $1,750 per month. She allocates exactly 50% of her income, which is $1,750, to cover these needs. The person then allocates $1,050 to discretionary items and $700 each month to retirement and savings. The person sets up an automatic transfer from her checking account to her savings account on her payday.
Six months later, the person is promoted. Because the person's income has changed, she reevaluates each budget amount. In addition, the person reviews her budget and adjusts as needed. She also realizes that her transportation expenses are higher than expected, so she decides to start carpooling with a colleague to reduce costs.
The person remains disciplined and consistent with her budgeting practice. She prioritizes financial well-being and regularly evaluates her progress toward her goals. As she progresses in her career, she continues to adjust her budget to reflect changes in her income and priorities. In the long run, the person has taken steps to not only have their needs met but have sufficient funds available for their future.
Can I Modify the Percentages in the 50/30/20 Rule to Fit My Circumstances?
Yes, you can modify the percentages in the 50/30/20 rule based on your circumstances and priorities. Adjusting the percentages can help you tailor the rule to better suit your financial goals and needs. This is especially relevant for people living in places with higher cost of living or for people that have loftier, higher long-term retirement saving needs.
Should I Include Taxes in the Calculation of the 50/30/20 Rule?
Taxes are typically excluded from the calculation of the 50%, 30%, 20% rule since it focuses on allocating income after taxes. You should consider your after-tax income when applying the rule. If you do decide to factor in taxes, be mindful to use gross income and appropriately forecast what your taxes will be.
How Can I Budget Effectively Using the 50/30/20 Rule?
To budget effectively using the 50%, 30%, 20% rule, track your expenses, prioritize essential needs, be mindful of wants, and consistently allocate savings or debt repayment within the designated percentage.
Can I Use the 50/30/20 Rule to Save for Long-Term Goals?
Yes, the 50/30/20 rule can be used to save for long-term goals. Allocate a portion of the 20% to savings specifically for your long-term goals, such as a down payment on a house, education funds, or investments. The rule is intentionally meant to bring focus to savings.
The Bottom Line
Saving is difficult, and life often throws unexpected expenses at us. By following the 50-20-30 rule, individuals have a plan with how they should manage their after-tax income. If they find that their expenditures on wants are more than 30%, they can find ways to reduce those expenses that will help direct funds to more important areas such as emergency money and retirement.
Life should be enjoyed, and it is not recommended to live like a Spartan, but having a plan and sticking to it will allow you to cover your expenses, save for retirement, all at the same time doing the activities that make you happy.

What Is an Emergency Fund?
The term “emergency fund” refers to money stashed away that people can use in times of
financial distress
. The purpose of an emergency fund is to improve financial security by creating a safety net that can be used to meet unanticipated expenses, such as an illness or major home repairs.
Assets in an emergency fund tend to be cash or other highly
liquid assets
. This reduces the need to either draw from high-interest debt options, such as
credit cards
or
unsecured loans
, or undermine your future security by tapping into
retirement funds
.
Spanish Translation of Emergency Fund
Key Takeaways
An emergency fund is a financial safety net for future mishaps and/or unexpected expenses.
Emergency funds should typically have three to six months’ worth of expenses, although the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown has led some experts to suggest up to one year’s worth.
Individuals should keep their emergency funds in accounts that are easily accessible and easily liquidated.
Savers can use tax refunds and other windfalls to build up their funds.
Some employers have established programs to encourage emergency fund saving.
Understanding Emergency Funds
You establish an emergency fund when you put away money that is intended to be used during times of financial hardship. This includes the loss of your job, a debilitating illness, or a major repair to your home or car—not to mention the kind of major economic crisis and lockdown
that happened in 2020
.
The best size for an emergency fund depends on a number of factors, including your financial situation, expenses, lifestyle, and
debts
. Many financial advisors recommend saving enough to cover anywhere from three to six months’ worth of expenses, which can help you weather a modest healthcare bill or a short bout of unemployment.
However, some experts argue for an even heftier cushion. Celebrity finance guru Suze Orman, for example, suggests an emergency fund that can handle up to eight months’ worth of outlays.
And she made that contention well before the 2020 crisis, a stark reminder of how sudden and deep an economic slump can be.
Individual circumstances may dictate the specific savings level with which you’re comfortable. For example, a single adult without children may be content covering three months of expenses, while the sole
breadwinner
for an entire family may want to have enough to cover half a year or more.
Research shows that many Americans are well short of the recommended range. In fact, a 2020 survey by the
Federal Reserve
found that more than one-fourth of Americans lacked the ability to cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalents. Among unemployed workers, that figure rose to 45%.
If you’re
living paycheck to paycheck
, you may want to start with more modest goals, such as putting 2% of your net income into a rainy day fund and slowly increasing your contribution rate every few months. Even a modest safety net can help buy you a little time should you face an unforeseen financial crisis.
It may be tempting to use your fund for incidental or frivolous purposes, so make sure that you don’t deplete this resource for any purpose other than an actual emergency.
How to Build an Emergency Fund
Starting early is the key to setting up an emergency fund, because it helps you build up a comfortable cushion against unexpected emergencies later in life.
Getting a start on emergency funds is relatively easy. Here are two simple ways to begin saving for one.
Set aside a comfortable amount from your salary each month.
Calculate your living expenses for the desired period, and make that your target for an emergency fund. You can then divert a portion of your paycheck—perhaps by setting up an
automatic transfer
—to that account each month. Once the fund is built up, invest extra savings for the long term or other goals, such as the down payment on a mortgage.
Once you’ve maxed out your retirement savings
, that money could go into an investment account with higher risks and rewards.
Save your tax refund.
You may be tempted to think of a tax refund or stimulus check as extra money for discretionary spending. Instead, consider diverting it toward your emergency fund to give you an added financial cushion.
You probably want to park your emergency fund in a vehicle that can be easily
liquidated
should a financial need suddenly arise. While storing cash in a savings account may be the safest approach, there are other relatively
secure ways to store a part of your emergency fund
that offer greater interest-earning potential. These include
high-interest savings accounts
,
money market accounts
, and no-penalty
certificates of deposit (CDs)
, which don’t charge savers a fee if they need to pull their money out before the maturity date.
You’ll have the access you need in an emergency but won’t be incurring fees and time delays associated with other vehicles, such as
brokerage accounts
.
You may want to
build an emergency fund
before venturing into volatile investment vehicles such as stocks. The latter offer greater long-term growth potential than cash and
cash equivalents
, but their value can suddenly decrease in the event of an economic downturn, as the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown made vividly clear. Should that be the moment when you need to tap them, you could lose more value. An emergency fund protects your
portfolio
against that risk.

Helping Employees Save
A number of major employers have introduced programs encouraging emergency savings because of the effects of financial instability on
productivity
and retirement security. Here’s a sampling of programs from three major companies.
Truist Financial Corp.:
Through its Truist Momentum program, the parent of SunTrust and BB&T banks offers $750 to employees who complete an eight-part financial education program, then open and fund an emergency savings account. More than 48,000 employees have graduated as of Aug. 6, 2021, according to the company.
Levi Strauss & Co.:
The apparel brand gives hourly employees up to $240 each in
matching funds
through its Red Tab Foundation when they make qualifying contributions to their savings accounts over a six-month period. Workers also receive a $20 bonus when they link their bank account to the company’s online platform.
Prudential Financial Inc.:
Retirement plans administered by Prudential allow employees to divert part of their paycheck toward a savings account, encouraging them to create a financial safety net. This feature serves as after-tax emergency savings and allows employees to withdraw the funds if an emergency arises, while preserving their before-tax retirement contributions.
Example of an Emergency Fund
Here’s a hypothetical example showing how to assemble an emergency fund. Let’s say a married couple has monthly expenses totaling $5,000. This includes the couple’s mortgage payments, food bills, car payments, and other necessary outlays. Using the three-month rule, the couple needs to set aside at least $15,000 (or $30,000 for six months and $40,000 for eight months) to address any unexpected financial burdens.
How much should I have in an emergency fund?
The amount varies according to your living expenses, but the general rule of thumb is to eventually save three to six months of living expenses.
How can I create an emergency fund if I am living paycheck to paycheck?
It won’t be easy, but instead of worrying about your eventual savings amount, decide on a percentage of take-home pay that you can do without. It can be 1% or 2%. The important thing is to save a set amount each payday and not touch it. The money will add up.
What is an emergency fund for?
As simple as the answer seems, it is important to make sure that you can distinguish between what is an emergency and what isn’t. An emergency is an unexpected bill that you can’t pay—not money to go to a movie or for some other nonessential expense.

If you're just getting started with investing, here's what you need to know.
If you've decided to start investing -- congratulations! By setting aside some of your money now in investments that could appreciate over time, you'll set yourself up for greater financial security in the future.
Now that you've decided that you want to invest, it's important to devote some time to learning
how
to invest. With that in mind, here are some basic concepts you should know before you get started.
Image source: Getty Images.
Why should I invest?
The easy answer to the question is: to create wealth. As a whole,
stock investments
have historically returned more than 9% per year, on average. If you invested $10,000 at this return rate for 40 years, it would grow to nearly $315,000.
Investing can help you reach your financial goals, such as paying for your children's
college education
, passing wealth to loved ones, or building a nest egg for your own
retirement
. There are many potential
reasons to invest money
.
How much should you invest?
There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Including
retirement accounts
, I generally suggest that you should aim to invest at least 10% of your income. In other words, if you contribute 4% of your salary to your 401(k), it could be a good goal to set aside 6% of your income to invest on your own.
The important thing is that you start as soon as possible, and make it a habit. When I started investing, I had $100 transferred into
my brokerage account
from every paycheck, automatically. This may not sound like much, but it sure can add up over time. You may be surprised at the
long-term impact
you can make by investing a seemingly
small amount of money
while you're young.
The basic types of investments
There are hundreds of things you can invest in, ranging from stocks and bonds to artwork and collectible coins. For our purposes, we're going to focus on investments you can choose in your brokerage account, or in your retirement plan at work. These generally include:
Stocks
: Also known as equities, stocks represent partial ownership of one or more companies. If a company does well, the stock can increase in value. Stocks have high return potential over long time periods but tend to be
more volatile
than other investments.
Bonds
: Also known as fixed-income investments, bonds are designed to create a steady stream of income. While bond values are somewhat
vulnerable to interest-rate
fluctuations, bonds are generally more stable than stocks, but with lower return potential.
Cash:
In addition to physical cash, this category includes
investments like CDs
,
money-market accounts
, and savings accounts. Cash investments have the lowest risk, but also the lowest return potential.
Mutual funds and ETFs
:
Mutual funds
and
exchange-traded funds
pool money from many investors and then invest it in an assortment of stocks, bonds, or other investments. For example, an
S&P 500
ETF
would invest in all 500 stocks that make up the index.
Asset allocation: Stocks vs. bonds vs. cash
Since stocks are highly volatile but have the most return potential, they are more appropriate for younger investors. In contrast, bonds are designed for predictability, making them better for older investors with lower risk tolerance. Cash investments are typically not a good idea unless you have lots of near-term liquidity needs. Determining the
appropriate asset allocation
for your investment strategy is a critical step to take.
Should I invest actively or passively?
There are two main methods of investing. Active investment refers to picking individual stocks and bonds or buying mutual funds that are actively managed by professionals. In other words, an active investor's goal is to
beat
the market.
On the other hand, passive investing means simply trying to match the market's performance, generally through
funds that track indexes
. For example, an S&P 500 ETF (mentioned in the prior section) is a passive investment vehicle.
The question you need to answer is how much time you want to spend on investing. If you have the time and desire to research individual stocks, active investment could be the way to go. If not, there's nothing wrong with passive investing. In fact, billionaire investor Warren Buffett believes that passive investing is the
best way to go
for many people.
How to choose stocks to invest in
If you choose to invest in individual stocks, the first thing you should understand is the difference between investing and speculating. Investing is a long-term activity, designed to achieve sustained returns that can
compound over time
. Speculating is akin to gambling -- trying to chase a quick payday.
With that in mind, there are certain types of stocks that make excellent long-term investments,
especially for beginners
. There are many things to look for in
your first stock investments
, but just to name a few: You'll want to
learn
basic ways to value stocks, identify durable
competitive advantages
, and understand how a business makes money. Of course, our writers at The Motley Fool regularly suggest some good beginner stocks, like
these examples
.
How to get started
Once you've learned the basics, and you've come up with your game plan, the next step is to
open a brokerage account
and put your plan into action. Be sure to shop around, as different brokerages charge different fees and offer different features. As a new investor, you'll want a brokerage which offers access to investment research and educational features, in order to help with stock selection and to answer any questions you might have along the way.

Investing Basics
Risk
All investments carry some degree of risk.
Stocks
,
bonds
,
mutual funds
and
exchange-traded funds
can lose value—even their entire value—if market conditions sour. Even conservative, insured investments, such as
certificates of deposit (CDs)
issued by a bank or credit union, come with inflation risk. That is, they may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.
What Is Risk?
When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to negatively impact your financial welfare.
For example, your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions (market risk). Corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company, can affect the value of your investments (business risk). If you own an international investment, events within that country can affect your investment (political risk and currency risk, to name two).
There are other types of risk. How easy or hard it is to cash out of an investment when you need to is called
liquidity risk
. Another risk factor is tied to how many or how few investments you hold. Generally speaking, the more financial eggs you have in one basket, say all your money in a single stock, the greater risk you take (
concentration risk
).
In short, risk is the possibility that a negative financial outcome that matters to you might occur.
There are several key concepts you should understand when it comes to investment risk.
Risk and Reward
The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class typically correlates with the level of return the investment might achieve. The rationale behind this relationship is that investors willing to take on risky investments and potentially lose money should be rewarded for their risk.
You can learn about risks associated with specific investments by going to the Risk tab for each investment listed in our
Investment Products
section.
In the context of investing, reward is the possibility of higher returns. Historically, stocks have enjoyed the most robust average annual returns over the long term (just over 10 percent per year), followed by corporate bonds (around 6 percent annually), Treasury bonds (5.5 percent per year) and cash/cash equivalents such as short-term Treasury bills (3.5 percent per year). The tradeoff is that with this higher return comes greater risk.
And although stocks have historically provided a higher return than bonds and cash investments (albeit, at a higher level of risk), it's not always the case that stocks outperform bonds or that bonds are always lower risk than stocks.
Time Can Be Your Friend or Foe
Based on historical data, holding a broad portfolio of stocks over an extended period of time (for instance a large-cap portfolio like the S&P 500 over a 20-year period) significantly reduces your chances of losing your principal. However, the historical data should not mislead investors into thinking that there is no risk in investing in stocks over a long period of time.
For example, suppose an investor invests $10,000 in a broadly diversified stock portfolio and 19 years later sees that portfolio grow to $20,000. The following year, the investor’s portfolio loses 20 percent of its value, or $4,000, during a market downturn. As a result, at the end of the 20-year period, the investor ends up with a $16,000 portfolio, rather than the $20,000 portfolio she held after 19 years. Money was made—but not as much as if shares were sold the previous year. That’s why stocks are always risky investments, even over the long-term. They don’t get safer the longer you hold them.
This is not a hypothetical risk. If you had planned to retire in the 2008 to 2009 timeframe—when stock prices dropped by 57 percent—and had the bulk of your retirement savings in stocks or stock mutual funds, you might have had to reconsider your retirement plan.
Investors should also consider how realistic it will be for them to ride out the ups and downs of the market over the long-term. Will you have to sell stocks during an economic downturn to fill the gap caused by a job loss? Will you sell investments to pay for medical care or a child’s college education? Predictable and unpredictable life events might make it difficult for some investors to stay invested in stocks over an extended period of time.
Managing Risk
You cannot eliminate investment risk. But two basic investment strategies—
asset allocation and diversification
—can help manage both systemic risk (risk affecting the economy as a whole) and non-systemic risk (risks that affect a small part of the economy, or even a single company).
Hedging (buying a security to offset a potential loss on another investment) and insurance products can provide additional ways to manage risk. However, both strategies typically add (often significantly) to the costs of your investment, which can eat away at returns. In addition, hedging typically involves speculative, higher risk activity such as short selling (buying or selling securities you don't own), trading in complex products such as
options
or investing in illiquid securities.
The bottom line is that all investments carry some degree of risk. By better understanding the nature of risk, and taking steps to manage those risks, you put yourself in a better position to meet your financial goals.

How to convert to a Roth IRA online
If your employer offers a retirement plan, like a 401(k) or 403(b), and will match a percentage of your contributions, you should definitely take advantage of it—after all, it's free money for you. Plus you'll have a tax-deferred account that makes saving a cinch through automatic payroll deduction.
If your employer doesn't offer a plan, then an IRA can be a good start to your retirement savings and another opportunity for your earnings to grow tax-free.
Facts & figures you need to know
401(k)
IRA
Who can participate
Anyone who works for an employer that offers a plan
Effective for 2020 contributions and later, anyone with earned income can open and contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2019 contributions and earlier, you could not make contributions to a traditional IRA after age 70½.
How much you can invest
If you're under age 50
, your annual contribution limit is $20,500 for 2022 and $22,500 for 2023.
If you're age 50 or older
, your annual contribution limit is $27,000 for 2022 and $30,000 for 2023.
If you're under age 50
, your annual contribution limit is $6,000 for 2022 and $6,500 for 2023.
If you're age 50 or older
, your annual contribution limit is $7,000 for 2022 and $7,500 for 2023.
Get details on IRA contribution limits & deadlines
What you can invest in
Most employers limit you to a preselected list of investment choices.
You can invest in a wide variety of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and individual stocks and bonds.
Pick investments for your IRA
How to get started
Your employer may automatically enroll you in the plan and offer you an easy way to contribute through automatic payroll deduction.
You can open an IRA on your own through almost any bank, brokerage company, insurance firm, or investment company.
Learn how to open your IRA
Eligible for both? Go for it
The good news is that you don't necessarily have to think IRA versus 401(k). You can save with both as long as you're qualified and heed contribution and income limits.

Learn how an IRA and a 401(k) can work together
If you're eligible to invest in a 401(k) and an IRA, here's an efficient way to do it:
Enroll in your company's 401(k) and contribute at least the amount that your employer will match.
Contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA.
Go back to your 401(k) plan and contribute beyond the match to the annual maximum allowed, if possible.
We recommend following these steps because an IRA offers more flexibility and choice, giving you a greater chance to diversify your assets and reduce your investment risk.

All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
When taking withdrawals from an IRA before age 59½, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax."

Here's a decade-by-decade guide to retirement planning

How to read this guide
Follow along from start to finish, or jump to the section(s) you want to learn more about.
Introduction
Saving for retirement is the gnarliest of delayed gratification challenges. Tucking money away today in retirement accounts with the intention you won't touch it for decades is not a habit that most brains are hard-wired to embrace.
But save we must.
For most people,
Social Security
benefits won't cover all the bills in retirement. To land in retirement in solid financial shape, you also want to build your own savings in 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts.
It's never too early to get started. (Hint: compound growth is your best investing friend.) Nor is it ever too late to make progress. (Another hint: Worried you won't have enough retirement income? Consider ways to reduce your spending needs in retirement.)
Like any big goal, breaking it down into manageable bite-size pieces keeps the task from veering into overwhelming. Focusing on a few key moves in each decade will set you up for a successful retirement.

Here's how much money you should have saved now

In your 20s: Cash in on compound growth
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:
You should aim to save about 1x your salary
Yes, you've got a lot of competing goals and, yes, retirement is a long way off. Understood. But the powerful math of
compound growth
means this is the decade where what you manage to save can exploit compound growth to its fullest.
Aim to save 10% of your gross salary pronto.
That's a minimum; crank it up to 15% and you're giving yourself a serious leg up. If you wait another decade to get rolling, you'll need to save at least 20%.
Focus on Roth options.
Retirement accounts come in two flavors: traditional and Roth. The big difference is when you pay tax. At this life stage, when you've yet to hit peak earnings,
saving in a Roth
can be smart.

Traditional IRA versus Roth IRA
Your Money
Got a workplace plan? Check what your employer chose for you.
If your employer auto-enrolled you into a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b), chances are your contribution rate was set way too low. Some plans start you at a rate that doesn't even enable you to pocket the matching maximum contribution most plans offer. And most plans choose an initial contribution rate that even with the maximum match won't get you near your 10% target. No worries. You can easily change your contribution rate. Ping HR.
No workplace plan?
Get rolling with an IRA.
If you're self-employed, or a contract worker, you can set up an IRA account at any discount brokerage. If you
qualify for a Roth IRA
, your maximum contribution in 2020 is $6,000. Able to save more? Check out a
SEP-IRA
; it allows self-employed workers to save more for retirement. Alas, SEPs only are traditional. There's no Roth option with a SEP.
Check out a target date fund.
If you're flummoxed by all the investment choices, a TDF can handle the work for you. A TDF automatically chooses a mix of stocks and bonds deemed appropriate based on how long you've got until you expect to retire.

How to Pick the Best Retirement Plan
.

Josephine Flood | CNBC
In your 30s: Stay (or get) focused
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:
You should aim to save about
3x your salary
If you're just getting started, aim to save at least 15% of your gross salary
;
20% is even better.
You don't have time for baby steps at this point. If you can't imagine immediately revving from zero to at least 15%, that's a sign it's time to — deep breath — commit to
budgeting
to find the cash to save.
Hands off what you have already saved for retirement.
If you contributed to a workplace retirement plan in your 20s, don't blow it by cashing out when you job hop. An unfortunate feature of workplace plans is that when you leave a job, one of your options is to cash out your retirement account. To be blunt: That's a crazy-bad move. There may be taxes, and there definitely will be a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Moreover, you've just robbed your future self of money you will need in retirement.

In your 40s: Monitor your spending
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:
You should aim to save about
4x your salary
The challenge in this decade is to not take on big-ticket spending that can make it hard to keep up with your retirement plan.
Get a ballpark of how you're doing.
After a decade (or, it's hoped, two) of saving for retirement, it's a good time to plug in what you've got saved up into an online calculator to get a rough estimate of what that might grow to by the time you're ready to retire. If the numbers give you pause, you've got time to crank up the saving. Can't see your way to do that? Keep reading.
Be on high alert for lifestyle creep.
One of the challenges of moving into your prime earning years is the tendency to spend more as you make more.
Lifestyle creep
has upended many a well-intentioned retirement plan. These are the years where buying the less expensive cars, taking the restorative vacations that don't break the bank and checking your tendency to always choose upgrades for whatever you're buying are all conscious ways to spend less so you have more to save.
It's also helpful to
commit to a strategy
for how much of every raise, bonus and one-off windfall, such as an inheritance, you will plunk into your retirement savings accounts.
Don't back up the truck for college.
This is a decidedly hard notion to consider, but insanely important. Ultimately what your kids really need from you is to be able to take care of yourself in retirement, so they don't need to chip in, at a point in their lives when they are likely in the throes of raising their own family. Start the college planning early, and focus on schools where your kid has a good shot at aid that will keep your family's
net price
manageable.

Josephine Flood | CNBC
In your 50s: Plan your retirement income
Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:
You should aim to save about
8x your salary
Saving as much as possible remains Job One. But now's also the time to start getting a sense of how the pieces of your retirement income puzzle will fit together.
Estimate your retirement income.
Online calculators will give you a ballpark of the income your retirement savings can generate over a 30-year retirement. (Yes, you should plan that long. More on this in the next decade). You'll also be asked to plug in an estimate of your Social Security payout. You're too close to retirement to spitball this.
Take a few minutes to log in to the
Social Security Retirement Estimator
to get estimates based on your earnings history. Scribble down what you might qualify for at your full retirement age (somewhere between 66 and 67) and if you wait until age 70. Plug those into the retirement calculator to see how it impacts your retirement income.
Put downsizing on the table.
If the first pass at estimating your retirement savings caused some serious agita, convincing yourself you will just work longer can be
dangerous magical thinking
, especially when a recession hits.
Downsizing sooner than later
can transform your retirement outlook from nerve-wracking to flush.
Save even more.
Once you turn 50, Uncle Sam allows you to save even more in 401(k) plans and IRAs. The catch-up contribution for 401(k) accounts is $6,000 per year. For IRAs, you can add another $1,000.
Get a pro's input
. Head spinning a bit? That's understandable. Saving for retirement is the easy part. Figuring out how to live off your savings and optimize Social Security is anything but. There are plenty of certified financial planners who work on an hourly or project basis to help you sort through your retirement options and hatch a plan.

Retirement savings goal by the end of this decade:
You should aim to save about
10x your salary
You've rounded the bend, with retirement in your sights. The big win this decade is to assume that you will live until 95.
Plan on a 30-year retirement.
Tune out the life expectancy numbers that make it into the news from time to time. That's the average from birth. What matters now is your life expectancy from where you're at today. Make it into your 60s and there's a good chance you will still be alive in your 90s. The Society of Actuaries'
Longevity Illustrator
may be the most important retirement planning tool at this life stage. Take a spin through the free tool to get a sense of how long you may need your retirement income plan to last.
Respect inflation.
With a potential 30-plus year retirement runway, you likely will want to keep some of your investment portfolio invested in stocks, which historically provide the best inflation-beating gains. Even at a low 1.5% annual inflation rate, what costs you $1,000 today will cost nearly $1,350 in 20 years and more than $1,550 in 30 years.
Wait until age 70 to start collecting Social Security
. The best investment move you can make in your 60s is to plan to delay taking Social Security. You can start as early as age 62, but you will get 25% to 30% less than if you wait until your FRA, when you are entitled to 100% of your earned benefit. Manage to delay past your FRA and your benefit will increased a guaranteed 8% each year until you reach 70.
Might you earn more if you took the payout earlier and invested in stocks? Perhaps. But you could also lose plenty, too. The
higher payout from delaying when you start Social Security
is guaranteed. For couples in good health, the strategy should be for the highest earner to delay until 70. It is less important when the other spouse claims.
Consider covering essential spending from guaranteed sources of income.
If your Social Security benefit won't cover all your fixed expenses (and you don't have a pension), a
single premium income annuity
can close the gap and make it easier to sleep at night, knowing you've got what you need regardless of what is going on in the markets.

How to get a handle on debt

There are many steps both big and small to getting a handle on your debt. If you’re unsure where to turn for help or who to trust, you’re not alone. We estimate that about
one in three people
have been contacted by a creditor or collector seeking to collect a debt within the past year.
No matter your reasons for changing your financial situation, there are resources available to help you pay off what you owe. If you want to take steps toward any of your financial goals, we’re here to help.
Consider working with a credit counselor
Credit counselors can advise you on ways to manage your money and debt and help you create and follow a budget, which can help you save or pay off a debt.
Credit counselors
are usually nonprofit organizations. To get started, you can try the
Financial Counseling Association of America
online or by phone at (800) 450-1794, or the
National Foundation for Credit Counseling
online or by phone at (800) 388-2227.
Then, check on the organization with your
state’s attorney general
or your
local consumer protection agency
.
A counselor may:
Offer
free educational materials
and workshops
Review
your budget
and come up with a plan to address your money problems
Help you decide which debts to pay first and understand what can happen if you stop making payments
Make an up-front agreement with your creditors to stop collections and not charge you late fees while you are in a debt management program
Develop a debt management plan
A credit counselor can help you develop a
debt management plan
for some or all of your debts. You may make one payment to the credit counseling organization each month or pay period to use toward payments to your creditors, which may help you focus on your other financial goals.
Credit counselors usually don’t try to reduce the amount of debt you owe. But they may be able to help lower your payments by having you make payments over a longer period, or they may get your creditors to lower your interest rate.
Beware of debt settlement companies that charge up-front fees in return for promising to settle your debts
Debt settlement companies
are different from
nonprofit credit counseling organizations
. These companies often claim they can make a deal with your creditors to reduce the amount of debt you owe. Beware of companies that charge up-front fees. Charging a fee before settling at least one of your debts is illegal for most debt settlement companies. Dealing with debt settlement companies can be risky; you may end up in more debt than when you started. That’s because many debt settlement companies:
Tell you to stop paying your creditors
Tell you they will negotiate with your creditors on your behalf
What they may not tell you is that not paying your debts while trying to settle them can lower your credit scores, add late fees and interest to your account, or cause creditors or debt collectors to file lawsuits against you. These can all slow your momentum toward financial growth.
You should avoid doing business with any debt settlement company that:
Charges any fees before it settles your debts
Tells you to stop communicating with your creditors
Guarantees it can make your debt go away
Tells you it can stop all debt collection calls and lawsuits
Promises you that it can settle all of your debt for a percentage reduction
Promotes a ""new government program"" to bail out personal credit card debt
Guarantees that your unsecured debts can be paid off for pennies on the dollar
You can check on the debt settlement company with your
state’s attorney general
or your
local consumer protection agency
.
Paying off debt can be a long journey. But using this information can get you on track to achieve your financial goals.
We have additional information about working with
debt collectors
, including sample letters you can use for your own situation. You can also
submit a complaint
about a debt collection issue or call us toll-free at (855) 411-CFPB (2372), Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET.
Pass it on! You can download this information in
English
or

There are several options for paying off
debt
, and that can sometimes feel overwhelming. You might be thinking about a DIY strategy combined with budgeting and side hustles to increase your income. Maybe you’re contemplating debt consolidation or feel you need to check out debt relief options.
Here’s how to choose a strategy, and some tools and tips that can help you get out of debt.
Assess your debt load
To a large extent, the best way to get out of debt will depend on how much you owe compared with your income.
Start by understanding whether you simply have
too much debt
. That gives you an idea of whether you can use a DIY strategy for payoff or should consider debt relief options.
The calculator below compares the amount you owe on key debt types, and compares it to your gross annual income (total pay before taxes or deductions).
Weigh DIY payoff methods
Debt snowball:
With this strategy for getting out of debt, you focus on paying off your smallest balance first. Put all the extra money you can dedicate to debt payoff toward that account while continuing to pay the minimums on the others.
When that debt is wiped out, add the amount you'd been paying on it to the minimum payment on the next largest debt. The amount you’re paying on the focus debt keeps growing like a snowball getting larger as you roll it.
Debt avalanche:
Focus on the debt with the highest interest rate first (while paying minimums on the others), then the next highest rate and so on.
This might save you money over the long run by wiping out the costliest debt first. But depending on the balance, it might take a while to zero out that first debt. If quicker wins would motivate you, snowball may be a better method.
Focus on high credit utilization:
You could also focus on paying down your credit cards with the highest
credit utilization
— the highest percentage of the credit limit being used. Credit utilization plays a big role in your credit score, so in this case paying down debt could have a side benefit of helping your score.
Consider debt consolidation to get out of debt faster
Debt consolidation
takes your high-interest debt, like credit card balances, and rolls them into one monthly payment, ideally at a lower interest rate. Some potential benefits of consolidating your debt include:
Lowering your interest rate.
Making your payments more manageable.
Shortening the time it takes to pay off your debt.
You might be able to use a
balance transfer credit card
or a
debt consolidation loan
, but note that you’ll likely need a good credit score to qualify. Each lender sets its own requirements, but generally scores of 690 or higher count as
good credit scores
.
It’s also possible to borrow from your
401(k)
or to consider using some of your
home equity
to pay debt — but be aware that you risk your retirement savings and your home in those cases.
Boost debt payoff with budgeting
If you feel like you don’t have enough money to cut down debt, getting clear on your
budget
may help. And keeping track of the money you have coming and going is always a good idea, no matter your financial goals.
Choose a system that works for you:
There’s no one-size-fits-all
budgeting system
, and budgeting can be harder for some people than others. For example,
being neurodiverse
can come with unique financial challenges. But the good news is that there are several ways to budget, and you can find the way that works for you, like the zero-based approach, the envelope system or the 50/30/20 budget.
Use technology to make things easier:
Technology can make budgeting easier by letting you keep track of all of your financial accounts, categorize your expenses and automate your payments. There are also several
budget apps
to help you stay on top of your money.
Lower your bills
Finding ways to reduce your monthly bills can help to free up more money to put toward debt payoff. And every little bit counts. Don’t be afraid to contact your service providers and see if you can negotiate a better rate on expenses like your
cell phone bill
or
energy bill
.
You may also be able to
negotiate your bills
for things like your car insurance, credit cards, gym memberships and cable service. Switching providers might get you a better deal. Do your research to compare the rates of different companies, be firm and don’t forget to make follow-up calls if needed.
Make more money
If you have the ability,
making more money
even in the short term can boost your debt repayment plan.
Consider getting a part-time job, selling gently used or unused items or using your skills to do freelance work. A side hustle like house sitting, driving for Uber or Lyft or even dog walking can fuel your progress.
Don’t rule out the possibility of increasing your current salary. Research and preparation may help you
negotiate more money
at your current job.
Don’t be afraid of debt relief
If you’ve tried budgeting, negotiating your payments and bringing in more cash, all to no avail, you might want to try debt relief.
Debt relief
can help you change the amount or the terms of your debt to lighten your financial burden, but it’s not for everyone.
You should also explore debt relief if paying off your unsecured debt like credit card bills, personal loans and medical debt within five years isn’t feasible or if your total amount of unsecured debt equals 50% or more of your gross income.
Debt management
typically involves working with an accredited counseling agency to pay off your debt at reduced interest rates or with waived fees.
Bankruptcy
— Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are the two most common forms — involves either erasing most unsecured debt or being placed on a court-approved repayment plan for three to five years.
Debt settlement
might suit people who don’t qualify for bankruptcy or who simply don’t want to file for it. You can try settling debt on your own by contacting creditors or you can hire a company to do it for you.

What is Market Structure?
Market structure, in economics, refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for goods and services. It is based on the characteristics that influence the behavior and outcomes of companies working in a specific market.
Some of the factors that determine a market structure include the number of buyers and sellers, ability to negotiate, degree of concentration, degree of
differentiation of products
, and the ease or difficulty of entering and exiting the market.
Summary
Market structure refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods.
The four popular types of market structures include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.
Market structures show the relations between sellers and other sellers, sellers to buyers, or more.
Understanding Market Structures
In economics, market structures can be understood well by closely examining an array of factors or features exhibited by different players. It is common to differentiate these markets across the following seven distinct features.
The industry’s buyer structure
The turnover of customers
The extent of product differentiation
The nature of costs of inputs
The number of players in the market
Vertical integration
extent in the same industry
The largest player’s market share
By cross-examining the above features against each other, similar traits can be established. Therefore, it becomes easier to categorize and differentiate companies across related industries. Based on the above features, economists have used this information to describe four distinct types of market structures. They include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.
Types of Market Structures
1.
Perfect Competition
Perfect competition occurs when there is a large number of small companies competing against each other. They sell similar products (homogeneous), lack price influence over the commodities, and are free to enter or exit the market.
Consumers in this type of market have full knowledge of the goods being sold. They are aware of the prices charged on them and the
product branding
. In the real world, the pure form of this type of market structure rarely exists. However, it is useful when comparing companies with similar features. This market is unrealistic as it faces some significant criticisms described below.
No incentive for innovation:
In the real world, if competition exists and a company holds a dominant market share, there is a tendency to increase innovation to beat the competitors and maintain the status quo. However, in a perfectly competitive market, the profit margin is fixed, and sellers cannot increase prices, or they will lose their customers.
There are very few barriers to entry:
Any company can enter the market and start selling the product. Therefore, incumbents must stay proactive to maintain market share.
2.
Monopolistic Competition
Monopolistic competition
refers to an imperfectly competitive market with the traits of both the monopoly and competitive market. Sellers compete among themselves and can differentiate their goods in terms of quality and branding to look different. In this type of competition, sellers consider the price charged by their competitors and ignore the impact of their own prices on their competition.
When comparing monopolistic competition in the short term and long term, there are two distinct aspects that are observed. In the short term, the monopolistic company maximizes its profits and enjoys all the benefits as a monopoly.
The company initially produces many products as the demand is high. Therefore, its Marginal Revenue (MR) corresponds to its Marginal Cost (MC). However, MR diminishes over time as new companies enter the market with differentiated products affecting demand, leading to less profit.
3.
Oligopoly
An oligopoly market consists of a small number of large companies that sell differentiated or identical products. Since there are few players in the market, their competitive strategies are dependent on each other.
For example, if one of the actors decides to reduce the price of its products, the action will trigger other actors to lower their prices, too. On the other hand, a price increase may influence others not to take any action in the anticipation consumers will opt for their products. Therefore, strategic planning by these types of players is a must.
In a situation where companies mutually compete, they may create agreements to share the market by restricting production, leading to supernormal profits. This holds if either party honors the Nash equilibrium state and neither is tempted to engage in the prisoner’s dilemma. In such an agreement, they work like monopolies. The
collusion
is referred to as cartels.
4.
Monopoly
In a monopoly market, a single company represents the whole industry. It has no competitor, and it is the sole seller of products in the entire market. This type of market is characterized by factors such as the sole claim to ownership of resources, patent and copyright, licenses issued by the government, or high initial setup costs.
All the above characteristics associated with monopoly restrict other companies from entering the market. The company, therefore, remains a single seller because it has the power to control the market and set prices for its goods.

My Finance 101 Notes
July 25, 2023. Today, I am re-summarizing some of the key points I’ve learned from CFI: Corporate Finance Fundamental course I took.
Let’s begin! ;)
Optimal Capital Structure
— company’s different sources of financing, such as debt, equity, and other financial instruments that allows the company to minimize its overall cost of capital and maximize shareholder value.
The optimal capital structure of a firm is often defined as the proportion of debt and equity that results to the lowest weighted average cost of debt and equity (WACC) of the firm.
As an indicator, if the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is lower than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) then it is advisable to either repurchase shares or pay cash dividends as it indicates that the company’s projects or investments are not generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. In other words, the company is not earning enough from its investments to cover the costs of financing those investments.
However, if the IRR was greater than the WACC of the business then it indicate that they may reinvest the project for better returns as it means that the project or investment is generating returns that exceed the cost of financing. In this situation, the company has an opportunity to earn more from the investment than it is paying in interest or financing costs.
WACC Formula
Cost of Equity
— the rate of return a shareholder requires for investing equity into business
Cost of Debt
— the rate of return a lender requires given the risk of the business
Terminologies;
Debt Capital
— raised by borrowing money from various sources, such as banks, bondholders, or other financial institutions. It includes different forms of debt securities. As companies pay interest on the borrowed funds, they are obligated to repay the principal amount within a specified period.
Equity Capital
— funds raised by issuing shares of ownership in the company to investors. Equity shareholders have ownership stakes in the company and may be entitled to voting rights and a share in the company’s profits through dividends.
Knowing that the optimal capital structure relies on equity versus debt decision, it is important to take note that HAVING TOO MUCH DEBT may increase the risk of default in repayment while DEPENDING TOO HEAVENLY ON EQUITY may dilute earnings and value for investors.
Other key factors to consider when determining the optimal capital structure:
Cost of Capital
Note: Debt is usually cheaper than equity due to tax advantages (interest payments are tax-deductible), but too much debt can increase financial risk and interest expenses.
2.
Risk Tolerance
Note: Higher debt levels can magnify financial risk, as debt obligations must be met regardless of the company’s performance.
3.
Industry and Business Characteristics
Note: The industry in which a company operates and its business model influence the optimal capital structure. Some industries may be more debt-heavy, while others may rely more on equity financing.
4.
Flexibility and Growth
Note: If you are expecting rapid growth or significant investment opportunities, prefer a capital structure that provides flexibility in raising additional funds.
5.
Market Conditions
Note: Market conditions, interest rates, and investor preferences also influence the availability and cost of debt and equity financing. This includes industry trends and company’s credit score.
6.
Debt Covenants and Restrictions
Note: Debt covenants and restrictions that come with borrowing can impact the company’s operational and financial flexibility as it may result to operational constraints, capital expenditure limitations, dividend and distribution restrictions, change of control provisions, additional collateral requirements, and costs of borrowing.

Pricing Strategy Under Each Market Structure
25 Sep 2021
Pricing strategy can be described as the range of methods that the firms use to price their products and services. Companies and firms always set prices in accordance with the market structure in which they operate.
Perfectly Competitive Market Pricing Strategy
This is determined by the market demand and supply curves of the product under discussion. The demand curve clearly indicates the total amount of a product that consumers are both willing and able to buy. On the other hand, the supply curve indicates the amount of a product that suppliers are willing and able to supply at certain market prices.
Suppliers can only supply what the consumers can consume at given prices. In a perfectly competitive market structure, the market sets the price and firms are merely price takers and therefore operate for as long as production costs fall below revenue.
Monopolistic Competitive Market Pricing Strategy
In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set prices for their products. Since every company sells a product that might be the same as that of another company, each company can successfully set its prices. However, these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. Since there are many producers, this will not affect the market as a whole. zolpidem gocce online

A company will use branding, advertising, and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently, there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products.
Also, since there are many competitors, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. As a result, companies will have control over their own prices.
Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy
Here, prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly, a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result, competition is based on product differentiation and services, but not on price wars.
Generally, an optimal pricing strategy, in the long run, incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors.
There are varied assumptions and strategies under oligopolistic competition as follows;
The game theory:
As oligopoly firms’ decisions are interdependent, pricing and output strategy preferences may be determined by how competitors react to their prices and output decisions. Consequently, the price will fluctuate between monopoly prices if firms collude successfully, and perfect competition prices equal marginal costs.
Collusion among competitors:
Assuming all producers agree to share the market to maximize industry profits, they will produce a quantity for which marginal costs equal marginal revenues and charge a price based on the demand curve for the quantity produced.
The kinked demand curve:
Firms produce the quantity of goods for which marginal revenue equals marginal cost so that competitors will match a price decrease and not an increase in prices. Since demand curves become kinked and the marginal revenue becomes discontinuous, the optimal quantity is the same for many cost structures.
The dominant firm model;
This scenario requires that the dominant firm produce the quantity for which its marginal costs equal its marginal revenues and charge the price indicated by its firm demand curve. Other companies in the marketplace will almost certainly accept that price as given, and they will produce quantities that have a marginal cost equal to the price.
Monopoly Market Structure
The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However, monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits, if you may, in favor of substitute products. Besides, raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand.
Question
In monopolistic competitive markets, firms:
are price takers.
set their own prices.
react to the prices set by competitors.
Solution
The correct answer is
B
.
In monopolistic competition, a firm won’t be affected by another firm’s strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding, advertising, and packaging to differentiate themselves.

So helpful. I have been using the videos to prepare for the CFA Level II exam. The videos signpost the reading contents, explain the concepts and provide additional context for specific concepts. 
The fun light-hearted analogies are also a welcome break to some very dry content.

I usually watch the videos before going into more in-depth reading and they are a good way to avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content when you look at the readings.

Professor James' videos are excellent for understanding the underlying theories behind financial engineering / financial analysis. The AnalystPrep videos were better than any of the others that I searched through on YouTube for providing a clear explanation of some concepts, such as Portfolio theory, CAPM, and Arbitrage Pricing theory. Watching these cleared up many of the unclarities I had in my head. Highly recommended.

Knowing how to work with the numbers in a company's
financial statements
is an essential skill for stock investors. The meaningful interpretation and analysis of
balance sheets
, income statements, and
cash flow statements
to discern a company's investment qualities is the basis for smart investment choices.
However, the diversity of
financial reporting
requires that we first become familiar with certain
financial statement
characteristics before focusing on individual corporate financials. In this article, we'll show you what the financial statements have to offer and how to use them to your advantage.
Key Takeaways
Understanding how to read a company's financial statements is a key skill for any investor wanting to make smart investment choices.
There are four sections to a company's financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, the cash flow statement, and the explanatory notes.
Prudent investors might also want to review a company's 10-K, which is the detailed financial report the company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
An investor should also review non-financial information that could impact a company's return, such as the state of the economy, the quality of the company's management, and the company's competitors.
1. Financial Statement = Scorecard
There are millions of individual investors worldwide, and while a large percentage of these investors have chosen
mutual funds
as the vehicle of choice for their investing activities, many others are also investing directly in stocks. Prudent investing practices dictate that we seek out quality companies with strong balance sheets, solid
earnings
, and positive
cash flows
.
Whether you're a do-it-yourself investor or rely on guidance from an investment professional, learning certain fundamental
financial statement analysis
skills can be very useful. Almost 30 years ago, businessman Robert Follett wrote a book entitled
How To Keep Score In Business
. His principal point was that in business you keep score with dollars, and the scorecard is a financial statement. He recognized that ""a lot of people don't understand keeping score in business. They get mixed up about profits,
assets
, cash flow, and
return on investment
.""
The same thing could be said today about a large portion of the investing public, especially when it comes to identifying investment values in financial statements. But don't let this intimidate you; it can be done.
2. Financial Statements to Use
The financial statements used in investment analysis are the balance sheet, the
income statement
, and the cash flow statement with additional analysis of a company's
shareholders' equity
and
retained earnings
. Although the income statement and the balance sheet typically receive the majority of the attention from investors and analysts, it's important to include in your analysis the often overlooked cash flow statement.
3. What's Behind the Numbers?
The numbers in a company's financial statements reflect the company's business, products, services, and macro-fundamental events. These numbers and the financial ratios or indicators derived from them are easier to understand if you can visualize the underlying realities of the fundamentals driving the
quantitative
information. For example, before you start crunching numbers, it's critical to develop an understanding of what the company does, its products and/or services, and the industry in which it operates.
4. Diversity of Reporting
Don't expect financial statements to fit into a single mold. Many articles and books on financial statement analysis take a one-size-fits-all approach. Less-experienced investors might get lost when they encounter a presentation of accounts that falls outside the mainstream of a so-called ""typical"" company. Please remember that the diverse nature of
business activities
results in a diverse set of financial statement presentations. This is particularly true of the balance sheet; the income statement and cash flow statement are less susceptible to this phenomenon.
5. Understanding Financial Jargon
The lack of any appreciable standardization of financial reporting terminology complicates the understanding of many financial statement account entries. This circumstance can be confusing for the beginning investor. There's little hope that things will change on this issue in the foreseeable future, but a good financial dictionary can help considerably.
Investopedia's
Glossary of Terms
provides you with thousands of definitions and detailed explanations to help you understand terms related to finance, investing, and economics.
6. Accounting: Art, Not Science
The presentation of a company's financial position, as portrayed in its financial statements, is influenced by management's estimates and judgments. In the best of circumstances, management is scrupulously honest and candid, while the outside auditors are demanding, strict, and uncompromising. Whatever the case, the imprecision that can be inherently found in the accounting process means that the prudent investor should take an inquiring and skeptical approach toward financial statement analysis.
7. Key Accounting Conventions
Generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) or
International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) are used to prepare financial statements. Both methods are legal in the United States, although GAAP is most commonly used. The main difference between the two methods is that GAAP is more ""rules-based,"" while IFRS is more ""principles-based."" Both have different ways of reporting asset values, depreciation, and inventory, to name a few.
8. Non-Financial Information
Information on the state of the economy, the industry, competitive considerations, market forces, technological change, the quality of management and the workforce are not directly reflected in a company's financial statements. Investors need to recognize that financial statement insights are but one piece, albeit an important one, of the larger investment puzzle.
9. Financial Ratios and Indicators
The absolute numbers in financial statements are of little value for investment analysis unless these numbers are transformed into meaningful relationships to judge a company's
financial performance
and gauge its financial health. The resulting ratios and
indicators
must be viewed over extended periods to spot trends. Please beware that evaluative financial
metrics
can differ significantly by industry, company size, and stage of development.
10. Notes to Financial Statements
The financial statement numbers don't provide all of the
disclosure
required by regulatory authorities. Analysts and investors alike universally agree that a thorough understanding of the
notes to financial statements
is essential to properly evaluate a company's financial condition and performance. As noted by auditors on financial statements ""the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements."" Please include a thorough review of the noted comments in your investment analysis.
11. The Annual Report/10-K
Prudent investors should only consider investing in companies with audited financial statements, which are a requirement for all publicly-traded companies. Perhaps even before digging into a company's financials, an investor should look at the company's
annual report
and the
10-K
. Much of the annual report is based on the 10-K, but contains less information and is presented in a marketable document intended for an audience of shareholders. The 10-K is reported directly to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC and tends to contain more details than other reports.
Included in the annual report is the
auditor's report
, which gives an auditor's opinion on how the accounting principles have been applied. A ""clean opinion"" provides you with a green light to proceed. Qualifying remarks may be benign or serious; in the case of the latter, you may not want to proceed.
12. Consolidated Statements
Typically, the word ""consolidated"" appears in the title of a financial statement, as in a
consolidated balance sheet
. A consolidation of a
parent company
and its majority-owned (more than 50% ownership or ""effective control"")
subsidiaries
means that the combined activities of separate legal entities are expressed as one economic unit. The presumption is that consolidation as one entity is more meaningful than separate statements for different entities.
Why are Financial Statements Important?
Financial statements provide investors with information about a company's financial position, helping to ensure corporate transparency and accountability. Understanding how to interpret key financial reports, such as a balance sheet and cash flow statement, helps investors assess a company’s financial health before making an investment. Investors can also use information disclosed in the financial statements to calculate
ratios
for making comparisons against previous periods and competitors.
What Key Financial Statements Should I Understand When Analyzing a Company?
Investors should start by learning how to interpret key figures on a company's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. Those wanting to dig a little deeper may want to consider learning how to analyze reports, such as shareholder’s equity and retained earnings. Investors can find a publicly traded company’s financial statements in its annual report or a 10-K filed with the SEC.
What’s the Difference Between GAAP and IFRS Accounting Conventions?
GAAP sets accounting guidelines and standards that companies must follow when preparing financial statements, whereas
IFRS
takes a more principles-based approach. Both conventions differ in how they report asset values, depreciation, and inventory. GAAP typically requires more disclosures than IFRS, with the latter providing much less overall detail. Both accounting methods are legal in the United States.
What are Some Key Limitations of Using Financial Statements?
Financial statements only provide a snapshot of a company's financial situation at a specific point in time. They also don't consider non-financial information, such as the health of the broader economy, and other factors, such as income inequality or
environmental sustainability
. Forward-looking financial statements rely on estimates and assumptions, which may not always be accurate and are subject to change.
The Bottom Line
Understanding the basics of financial statements provides investors with valuable information about a company's financial health. Investors can use key reports, such as a balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement, to evaluate a company's performance, helping to make more informed investment decisions. However, it’s also important to understand the limitations of overly relying on financial statements and consider other metrics, such as the impact of non-financial information, when analyzing a company's overall financial position. Financial statements play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the
financial system
and promoting trust between companies and investors.

John Rotonti:
Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin.
Chris Hill:
I'm Chris Hill, and that was Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti. What are you buying when you buy a stock? No, really, what are you buying? Today John kicks off a two-part series on the basics of financial statements, including what goes into a balance sheet, how the sale of a burrito at
Chipotle
(
CMG
-0.50%
)
become shareholder equity, and how financial statements work together.
John Rotonti:
Fools, John Rotonti here. Today we are going to be talking about the three primary financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. Let's just start with the balance sheet really quickly. The balance sheet, Fools, is called the balance sheet because it must balance at all times, and the simple formula is assets equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity, and that must always balance. A must always equal L plus SE, assets equals liabilities plus shareholders equity. Let's just look at a quick example using Chipotle, ticker CMG. Chipotle has total assets, so assets of 6,653 million. Then it has total liabilities of 4,355.6 million and total shareholders' equity of 2,297.4 million. If you remember, A, assets, equals liabilities plus shareholders' equity. So if we take the liabilities of Chipotle of 4,355.6, and we add the shareholders' equity of 2,297.4, you will get the total assets of 6,653 to the penny. To the penny, Fools, the balance sheet must balance at all times. Assets must be equal liabilities plus shareholders' equity. Then, of course, we can reconfigure that basic formula to get shareholders' equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities. All we've done is move some variables from one side of the equation to the other. Shareholders' equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities. Assets minus liabilities is how you get shareholders' equity. If we do that again, if we take total assets of 6,653, and we subtract total liabilities of 4,355.6, you will get total shareholders' equity of 2,297.4. Now that is why it is called the balance sheet. The left-hand of that equation, A equals L plus SE, assets, is what the company owns; liabilities, what the company owes. Now, when you're looking at a balance sheet, it starts at the top of the balance sheet with the most liquid assets, and it moves down the balance sheet. As you move down the balance sheet, those assets become less liquid. The definition of liquidity is the speed and ease at which you could turn the asset into cold, hard cash. The very top line of the balance sheet is cash and cash equivalents. That's already cash. That's the most liquid, Fools. You don't need to convert it to cash. That's why it's at the top.
Then we move down the balance sheet, and we get things like account. I'm not going to go line for line because if I was teaching this class at an MBA level, I'll probably spend three or four full classes, just on the balance sheet. So I can't go line by line. But then you have things like accounts receivable, which is money owed to Chipotle that has not yet been paid. That's an asset. It is owed to Chipotle. Those receivables, when people buy on credit and stuff, they're going to receive those pretty quickly. So that's pretty liquid. It's going to be turned into cash pretty quickly. Inventories, the raw materials, the food that they plan to sell, you can turn that into cash pretty quickly too because we're talking about a restaurant here. Those raw fresh ingredients that Chipotle is known for, they're going to spoil. They're going to expire. They have to use those ingredients and sell them within a day or two or something like that. They can convert inventories, which is another asset to cash pretty quickly, so it's liquid. But then you move down that balance sheet, and you get things like property, plant, and equipment, literally, buildings, facilities, all of the expensive kitchen equipment they have, property, plant, equipment. They can't turn that into cash immediately. If they wanted to sell that stuff, they'd have to get a broker, find a buyer, write up some contracts, some agreement, it takes time. So it's less liquid. There's other long-term investments as well, such as goodwill.
Every company start with zero goodwill, believe it or not, zero goodwill. A company only gets goodwill on its balance sheet when it acquires another company and pays above book value. That's how you acquire goodwill. It's something that ends up on your balance sheet when you buy another company, and it's an asset. Then you have liabilities. You have payables. That's money that you owe, but you have not paid yet. You have short-term debt. You have short-term leases, then you have long-term leases. You have long-term debt. There are other liabilities as well, but once again, you move from the most liquid down through the balance sheet to the least liquid. Now shareholders' equity has two other names. They all mean the same thing. They're synonyms. Shareholders' equity is also book value. How do you calculate book value? Total assets minus total liabilities. Book value is literally the value of your assets, what you own minus your total liabilities, what you owe. The other synonym for total equity is net worth. This is the company's net worth. Just like you can calculate your personal net worth based on your total assets, what you own, minus your total liabilities, what you owe. So total shareholders equity is equal to book value is equal to net worth. One last thing before I move on to the next financial statement. Think of assets, as we've said, that's what you own, that's the left-hand side of that equation. The other side of the equation, liabilities and shareholders' equity is the sources of funds to buy those assets. Think about it this way. This is going to be exciting. Assets are the uses of the funds. That's the uses of the funds. The company takes the right-hand side of the equation, the liabilities, i.e, debt, and shareholders' equity, i.e, what owners contribute. Those are the two primary sources of funds, and the company takes those to buy or build assets, the left-hand side of the equation, the uses of those funds. That's the balance sheet, Fools, called the balance sheet because it must balance at all times.
We're going to switch over to the income statement really quickly, sticking with Chipotle here. Some people call this the profit and loss statement, the P&L. We went over this in a prior segment, but it's important to review again because we're going to need it for when we get to the cash flow statement. So bear with me really quickly. The sale or revenue, think of those words as synonyms. I think a lot of companies that actually sell a tangible product use the word sales, and companies like software that don't sell tangible product that you can touch and feel use the word revenue. Think of sales for products, and revenue for software and services. But honestly, I've seen product companies use the word revenue, and I've seen software and services company use word sales. It doesn't matter. Honestly, sales and revenue are the exact same thing, and they are the top line of the income statement. They are the top line because they are at the top of the piece of paper. The sale is what happens at the point of sale.
In Chipotle's case, it is when the customer goes into the store, and orders, and pays for it at the point of sale system. These things used to be called cash registers. Now they're like little square iPads or whatever, but it's a point of sale computer system, called a POS, or when someone orders online and press ""Buy"" online, that's the point of sale. That is the sale. So you go into Chipotle, you buy a $7 chicken burrito or whatever and a drink. I think the average chicken at Chipotle is probably somewhere around $12 with tax, all in, I think. But let's just use a $7 burrito, that's the sale. From that, we subtract the cost of goods sold. That is all of the input costs as well as the employee wages that go into making that burrito. This does not include the salary of the CEO, and the COO, and everything else back at headquarters. This includes the people working in the Chipotle kitchen, on the frontline, on the backline, contributing in making that burrito. Those are wages that are included in cost of goods sold. It also includes all of the food, all the raw materials, all the ingredients. You got to have the chicken, or whether it's beef, or pork, whatever you're putting in your burrito. Avocados, those things are expensive. Those things are going through the moon. Avocados, tomatoes, onions, other basil, and spices that go into their spices and their sauces. Lettuce, I said onions, peppers. The chips, can't go to Chipotle without getting those chips, right? The tortillas, the wraps, anything that they need to make that Chipotle goes in that cost of goods sold. You take revenue, the $7 burrito, you subtract your cost of goods sold, and you get a number called gross profit. This is what we talk about when we're talking about unit economics.
If a company can price its products higher than its input costs, it will generate a gross product at the burrito level. That's the unit level. So that's its gross profit. Now, if you want to calculate the gross, we just said gross profit, sales minus cost of goods sold, you get gross profit. If you want to calculate the gross profit margin, you simply take that absolute gross profit dollar amount, the gross profits, and divide it by sales. When you are calculating a margin, you simply take the profit dollar amount that you're looking at and scale it by sales, divide it by sales. So gross profit margin is gross profit divided by sales. Now when you're talking about gross profit, you are talking about unit economics, you're also talking about pricing power. What if sales grow a little faster than cost of goods sold grow? You know the answer. That means your gross profit margin is going to increase over time, a sign of pricing power. Pricing power is if you can increase the price of something to offset input cost inflation without decreasing demand for the product. That's pricing power, and one of the main places we see that and capture that in the numbers in the story is from the gross profit margin. So we have gross profit. From that, we subtract operating expenses. You got to keep the lights on. You got to pay your utilities. You got to pay your water bill. You have to pay all of the other salaries and expenses back at headquarters, if there's research and development, the research and development cost to come up with new recipes, sales and marketing. So R&D, research and development, sales and marketing, all of these things are operating expenses. These are cost of doing business. That's operating expenses. So gross profit, you subtract these operating expenses, you got to keep your lights on, you get operating income.
Now if you haven't been paying attention, you should start now. Operating income is also called earnings before interest and taxes, E-B-I-T or EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes. That's operating income. From operating income or EBIT, E-B-I-T, we subtract the interest expense on the debt, if the company has any debt, of which Chipotle does. Notice debt holders get paid first. They have a primary claim on a company's cash flows. There is a packing order, Fools, to who gets paid. Debt holders, or creditors, they get paid first. We just paid the I, the interest expense. Remember, we had E-B-I-T. We just pay the interest, so now we are left with E-B-T, earnings before taxes. So who gets paid next? The government in the form of taxes. So debt holders get paid first, and then the government in the form of taxes. Now what is left over after the company has paid its cost of goods sold, after the company has paid all of those other operating expenses, utility bills, research and development, sales and marketing, after the company has paid its interest on its debt, if it has any, after the company has paid its taxes to the government, if there is money left over, that is called net income, or net profit, or net earnings.
The three words mean the same thing, and that, Fools, is what you are buying as a shareholder. We get the residual claim of what is left over after all of those expenses we just went through are paid. We get residual claim. We get the bottom line. Why is it called the bottom line? Because it is at the bottom of the income statement. We get what is leftover. We have a residual claim on a company's cash flows. When you buy a stock, legally, what are you buying? When you buy a stock, you are buying a claim on the company's future net income, or future net profits, or future net earnings. You are buying a very small percentage of the company's future net income. That, Fools, is the income statement. Now why do I want to go through that? Because when you buy a stock, that's what you're legally buying, but also because we need to go to the cash flow statement, the third financial statement. Now remember how I just said net income is the bottom line of the cash flow statement? Guess what, net income, the same exact number that's on that income statement, then becomes the top line of the cash flow statement. [MUSIC] This is critical to understand. This is critical. The bottom line of the income statement, net income, becomes the top line of the cash flow statement.

Financial Analysis
What is Net Present Value?
Net present value is an analysis tool used to decide whether to invest in a
capital asset
. It is employed as part of the
capital budgeting
process. A desirable investment is one that yields a positive net present value, which implies that a business will receive excess
cash
over time as a result of the
investment
. A negative net present value indicates that a company will lose money on a proposed investment. A negative net present value is usually grounds to terminate an investment that is under consideration.
How to Calculate Net Present Value
Net present value is calculated as the difference between the present value of one or more inbound
cash flows
and one or more outbound cash flows. The
discounted cash flow
methodology is used to derive
present value
, using a
discount rate
as the basis for the discounting. The discount rate is typically based on the
cost of capital
of the business running the analysis. If the cash flows associated with a proposed investment are expected to be unusually risky, then the discount rate may be increased, thereby reducing the net present value of the associated cash flows.
Advantages of Net Present Value
A key benefit of net present value is that it reduces the cash flows associated with a project to one numeric value, which can be easily compared to the net present values of other projects. The project generating the highest net present value is then selected for investment, while the other projects are assigned a lower priority or rejected.
Disadvantages of Net Present Value
Net present value is not a perfect analysis tool, for it suffers from several problems. First, estimated cash flows rarely match actual results, especially when the original estimates are excessively optimistic. Second, the discount rate used for a
capital asset
analysis may not be appropriate, given the incremental cost of the capital required to fund a project. Third, an adjustment of the discount rate to account for risk is usually a guess; there is no quantitative derivation of the adjustment. And finally, an investment based on a net present value analysis only looks at the circumstances of a specific investment, rather than the entire system of profit generation; thus, investments using NPV can be sub-optimized.

5 Methods for Capital Budgeting
5 Methods for Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting is defined as the process used to determine whether capital assets are worth investing in. Capital assets are generally only a small portion of a company’s total assets, but they are usually long-term investments like new equipment, facilities and software upgrades. By incorporating strategically planned capital budgeting into their financial processes, companies can more effectively determine and prioritize which projects, programs and other investment assets could be most financially beneficial in the long-term. As these assets often only generate tangible returns in the long-term, it is important that practicing finance professionals develop an understanding of the five primary methods of capital budgeting, and how they can be utilized to decide the best course of action when firms are planning their next significant capital investment.
Internal Rate of Return
The internal rate of return calculation is used to determine whether a particular investment is worthwhile by assessing the interest that should be yielded over the course of a capital investment. It is determined by using a particular formula that must be calculated through trial-and-error or by using specific software. As the internal rate of return helps aid investors in measuring the profitability of their potential investments, the ideal internal rate of return for a project should be greater than the cost of capital required for the project, as it can be assumed that the project will be a profitable one.
Professionals who hope to maximize the potential of their capital investments need to leverage the internal rate of return when necessary, especially in instances where they are planning on analyzing an investment in venture capital, private equity or other operations that require a consistent cash investment that ends with a large payout, like a sale. When using this calculation, finance professionals should recognize that the measurement for the internal rate of return is similar to the net present value metric (another capital budgeting method); however, the internal rate of return is formulated to make the net present value of all cash flows in a project equal to zero. It is for this reason that companies shouldn’t rely solely on the internal rate of return calculation to project profitability of a project and should use it in conjunction with at least one other budgeting metric, like net present value.
Net Present Value
Net present value (NPV) is used for the same purpose as the internal rate of return, analyzing the projected returns for a potential investment or project. The net present value represents the difference between the current value of money flowing into the project and the current value of money being spent. The value can be calculated as positive or negative, with a positive net present value implying that the earnings generated by a project or investment will exceed the expected costs of the venture and should be pursued. Also, unlike other capital budgeting methods, like the profitability index and payback period metrics, NPV accounts for the time value of money, so opportunity costs and inflation are not ignored in the calculation. To achieve this, the net present value formula identifies a discount rate based on the costs of financing an investment or calculates the rates of return expected for similar investment options.
Unlike some capital budgeting methods, NPV also factors in the risk of making long-term investments. Therefore, the formula for net present value is longstanding and effective, but professionals in the industry must still recognize the potential room for error that arises when relying on calculations like investment costs, rates of discount, and projected returns, all of which rely heavily on assumptions and estimates. As accounting for unexpected expenses can be difficult when budgeting for capital investments, it is important to consider using payback period metrics and the internal rate of return as possible alternatives to net present value calculations when evaluating a project or investment.
Profitability Index
The profitability index is a capital budgeting tool designed to identify the relationship between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was successful. The profitability index employs a ratio that consists of the present value of future cash flows over the initial investment. As this ratio increases beyond 1.0, the proposed investment becomes more desirable to companies. When this ratio does not exceed 1.0, the investment should be deferred, as the project’s present value is less than the initial investment.
The caveat to using the profitability index for capital budgeting is that the technique does not account for the size of a project; therefore, sizable projects with significantly large cash flow figures often claim lower profitability indexes because of their slimmer profit margins. The upside of using the profitability index is that the index does account for the time value of investments in the calculation. It also identifies the exact rate of return for a project or investment, which makes understanding the cost-benefit ratio of projects easier.
Accounting Rate of Return
The accounting rate of return is the projected return that an organization can expect from a proposed capital investment. To discover the accounting rate of return, finance professionals must divide the average profit by the initial investment. The accounting rate of return is a useful metric for quickly calculating the profitability of a company, and it is widely used for analyzing the success rates of investments that feature multiple projects.
However, the accounting rate of return metric also has some minor drawbacks when used as the sole method for capital budgeting. The first drawback is that it does not account for the time value of the money involved—meaning that future returns may be worth significantly less than the returns currently being taken in. A second issue with relying solely on the accounting rate of return in capital budgeting is the lack of acknowledgement of cash flows. In contrast to these drawbacks, the accounting rate of return is quite useful for providing a clear picture of a project’s potential profitability, satisfying a firm’s desire to have a clear idea of the expected return on investment. This method also acknowledges earnings after tax and depreciation, making it effective for benchmarking a firm’s current level of performance.
Payback Period
The payback period is a unique capital budgeting method. Specifically, the payback period is a financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been invested. A subcategory, price-to-earnings growth payback period, is used to define the time required for a company’s earnings to find equivalence with the stock price paid by investors. The price-to-earnings growth payback period is also widely used to get a basic understanding of how risky an investment opportunity may be. Understanding the payback period of an investment limits the risks associated with taking on costly projects.
Payback periods are an integral component of capital budgeting and should always be incorporated when analyzing the value of projected investments and projects. The payback period can prove especially useful for companies that focus on smaller investments, mainly because smaller investments usually don’t involve overly complex calculations. Payments made at a later date still have an opportunity cost attached to the time that is spent, but the payback period disregards this in favor of simplicity. As with each method mentioned so far, the payback period does have its limitations, such as not accounting for the time value of money, risk factors, financing concerns or the opportunity cost of an investment. Therefore, using the payback period in combination with other capital budgeting methods is far more reliable.
When employing capital budgeting strategies at their respective businesses, finance professionals have a wide array of tools, formulas, and methods available to them. Yet, even with so many tools and options at hand, it’s important that firms remain mindful of their cash flows and capital assets to ensure that their investments prove profitable in the long-term. This way, companies can reap full benefits of capital budgeting by identifying and prioritizing the large investments, which are most likely to have a long-term impact on the company or organization.

What is Financial Modeling?
Financial modeling
is one of the most highly valued, but thinly understood, skills in financial analysis. The objective of financial modeling is to combine accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.
A financial model is simply a spreadsheet which is usually built in Microsoft Excel, that forecasts a business’s financial performance into the future. The forecast is typically based on the company’s historical performance and assumptions about the future, and requires preparing an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and supporting schedules (known as a
three-statement model
).
From there, more advanced types of models can be built such as discounted cash flow analysis (
DCF model
), leveraged buyout (
LBO
), mergers and acquisitions (
M&A
), and sensitivity analysis. Below is an example of financial modeling in Excel:
Image: CFI’s
Financial Modeling Courses
.
Key Highlights
Financial modeling combines accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.
The main goal of financial modeling is to accurately project a company’s future financial performance.
Modeling can be useful for valuing companies, determining whether a company should raise capital or grow the business organically or through acquisitions.
What is a Financial Model Used For?
There are many
types of financial models
with a wide range of uses. The output of a financial model is used for decision-making and performing financial analysis, whether inside or outside of the company. Financial models are used to make decisions about:
Raising capital (debt and/or equity)
Making acquisitions (businesses and/or assets)
Growing the business organically (e.g., opening new stores, entering new markets, etc.)
Selling or divesting assets and business units
Budgeting and
forecasting
(planning for the years ahead)
Capital allocation (priority of which projects to invest in)
Valuing a business
Financial statement analysis/ratio analysis
Management accounting
What Software is Best for Financial Modeling?
Forecasting a company’s operations into the future can be very complex. Each business is unique and requires a very specific set of assumptions and calculations.
Excel is used
because it is the most flexible and customizable spreadsheet tool available. Other software programs may be too rigid and specialized, whereas Excel knowledge is generally more universal.
Who Builds Financial Models?
There are many different types of professionals who build financial models. The most common types of career tracks are investment banking, equity research, corporate development, FP&A, and accounting (due diligence, transaction advisory, valuations, etc).
How Can You Learn Financial Modeling?
The best way to learn financial modeling is to practice. It takes years of experience to become an expert at
building financial models
,
and you really have to learn by doing. Reading equity research reports can be helpful, as they give you something to compare your results to. One of the best ways to practice is to take a mature company’s historical financials, build a model into the future, calculate the net present value per share, and compare your projections to current share prices or the target prices in equity research reports.
Taking a professional
financial modeling training course
also offers a solid base understanding of the relevant concepts and skills. In the meantime, you may be interested in exploring CFI’s
free Financial Modeling Guidelines
or having a go at building your own financial models.
Image: CFI’s
Financial Modeling Courses
.
How Much Accounting Knowledge is Required for Financial Modeling?
In order to build a financial model, you need a solid understanding of
accounting fundamentals
. You have to know what all the various accounts mean, how to calculate them, and how they’re connected. We recommend having at least a few accounting courses under your belt.

Learn more about Financial Modeling
Financial modeling is the application of data analysis to predict business performance, manage assets, and track cash flow. Financial modeling is a vital tool, essential for a business to succeed, whether it is a startup or a Fortune 500 company. A financial modeling course on Udemy can familiarize you with the concepts and strategies vital to business success.
Frequently asked questions
What is financial modeling?
Research analysts, investment bankers, accountants, and entrepreneurs use financial modeling to better understand a company’s performance before making important business decisions. Financial models are generated using MS Excel and can help you accomplish a variety of important tasks such as forecasting business performance, budgeting, asset management, and understanding cash flow. Financial modeling requires a keen sense of numbers and data to prepare the best financial reports for yourself or your clients.
What are some examples of financial models and what are they used for?
There are several different types of financial models used by professionals to help them make the best business decisions. Financial models help professionals make important business decisions about raising capital, forecasting business changes and requirements, or what it will take to grow a business. Some examples of these useful financial models are the discounted cash flow (DCF), a valuation method used to determine the worth of investing in a business; leveraged buyout (LBO), which examines the impact of funding an acquisition with debt; and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a method that analyzes the result of acquiring or merging with another company. These are just three of the models both new and seasoned financial professionals should expect to use in their careers.
What does an investment banker do?
Investment bankers assist corporations and individual investors by making a variety of critical decisions to best ensure the success of their business and financial growth. Investment bankers work in four areas of the financial services industry: capital markets, advisory, trading and brokerage, and asset management. Investment bankers usually work for investment banks that serve business clients. These banks are not like traditional commercial banks that members of the public use to handle their checking and savings accounts. In fact, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 requires a complete separation between investment banking and commercial banking. Investment bankers provide guidance and expertise to corporate clients seeking to issue an IPO (initial public offering) to raise capital that they could use to expand a business, acquire, or merge with another company.
What are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows?
Balance sheets help business owners, investment bankers, and accountants understand the assets of a business. In particular, balance sheets outline what the business owns, or its assets. It also notes what the business owes, or its debt and liabilities. A company’s income statement is just as important as its balance sheet and tells you how much profit a company generated during a particular year. The statement of cash flows is a useful tool for stakeholders and can provide insight into how effectively the organization manages its operations. Businesses use a statement of cash flows to understand a company’s performance, more specifically, to assess a company’s ability to generate cash from operations, financing, and investing.

What Is Risk Management?
Risk management involves identifying,
analyzing
, and accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. Put simply, it is the process of monitoring and dealing with the financial risks associated with investing. Risk management essentially occurs when an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment, such as a
moral hazard
, and then takes the appropriate action (or inaction) to meet their objectives and
risk tolerance
.
Key Takeaways
Risk management is the process of identification, analysis, and acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decisions.
Risk is inseparable from return in the investment world.
Risk management strategies include avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction.
One of the tactics to ascertain risk is standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of dispersion around a central tendency.
Investopedia / Joules Garcia
How Risk Management Works
Risk is inseparable from return. Every investment involves some degree of risk. It can come close to zero for U.S. T-bills or very high for emerging-market equities or real estate in highly inflationary markets. Risk is quantified in absolute and in relative terms. A solid understanding of risk in its different forms can help investors to better understand the opportunities, trade-offs, and costs involved with different
investment approaches
.
Risk management involves identifying and analyzing where risk exists, and making decisions about how to deal with it. It occurs everywhere in the realm of finance. For instance:
An investor may choose
U.S. Treasury
bonds over corporate bonds
A fund manager may hedge their currency exposure with currency
derivatives
A bank performs a credit check on an individual before issuing a personal line of credit
A stockbroker uses financial instruments like
options
and
futures
A money manager uses strategies like portfolio diversification, asset allocation, and position sizing to mitigate or effectively manage risk
Diligent risk management can help reduce the chance of losses while ensuring that financial goals are met. Inadequate risk management, though, can result in severe consequences for companies, individuals, and the economy. The
subprime mortgage meltdown
that led to the Great Recession stemmed from bad risk management. Lenders gave mortgages to people with bad credit and investment firms bought, packaged, and resold these loans to investors as risky,
mortgage-backed securities (MBSs)
.
Risk Management Techniques
The following is a list of some of the most common risk management techniques.
Avoidance:
The most obvious way to manage your risk is by avoiding it completely. Some investors make their investment decisions by cutting out volatility and risk completely. This means choosing the safest assets with little to no risks.
Retention:
This strategy involves accepting any risks that come your way and acknowledging that they come with the territory.
Sharing:
This technique comes with two or more parties taking on an agreed-upon portion of the risk. For instance,
reinsurers
cover risks that insurance companies can't handle on their own.
Transferring:
Risks can be passed on from one party to another. For instance, health insurance involves passing on the risk of coverage from you to your insurer as long as you keep up with your
premiums
.
Loss Prevention and Reduction:
Rather than eliminate the potential for risk, this strategy means that you find ways to minimize your losses by preventing them from spreading to other areas. Diversification may be a way for investors to reduce their losses.
The word risk is often thought of negatively. But risk is an integral part of the investment world and is inseparable from performance.
Risk Management and Volatility
Investment risk is the deviation from an expected outcome. This deviation is expressed in absolute terms or relative to something else like a market
benchmark
. Investment professionals generally accept the idea that the deviation implies some degree of the intended outcome for your investments, whether positive or negative.
To achieve higher returns, one expects to accept the greater risk. It is also a generally accepted idea that increased risk means increased
volatility
. While investment professionals constantly seek and occasionally find ways to reduce volatility, there is no clear agreement on how to do it.
How much volatility an investor should accept depends entirely on their risk tolerance. For investment professionals, it is based on the tolerance of their investment objectives. One of the most commonly used absolute risk metrics is
standard deviation
, which is a statistical measure of
dispersion
around a central tendency.
Here's how it works. Take the average return of an investment and find its average standard deviation over the same time period. Normal distributions (the familiar bell-shaped curve) dictate that the expected return of the investment may be one standard deviation from the average 67% of the time and two standard deviations from the average deviation 95% of the time. This provides a numeric risk evaluation. If the risk is tolerable (financially and emotionally), they can invest.
Risk Management and Psychology
Behavioral finance
highlights the imbalance between people's views of gains and losses. In prospect theory, an area of behavioral finance introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1979, investors exhibit loss aversion
.
They noted that investors put roughly twice the weight on the pain associated with a loss than the good feeling associated with a profit.
Investors often want to know the losses that come with an investment as well as how much an asset deviates from its expected outcome.
Value at risk (VAR)
tries to quantify the degree of loss associated with an investment with a given level of confidence over a defined period. For example, an investor may lose $200 on a $1,000 investment with a 95% level of confidence over a two-year
time horizon
. Keep in mind that a measure like VAR doesn't guarantee that 5% of the time will be much worse.
It also doesn't account for any outlier events, which hit hedge fund
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)
in 1998. The Russian government's default on its outstanding sovereign debt obligations threatened to bankrupt the hedge fund, which had highly
leveraged
positions worth over $1 trillion. Its failure could have collapsed the global financial system. But the U.S. government created a $3.65-billion loan fund to cover the losses, which enabled LTCM to survive the volatility and liquidate in early 2000.
The confidence level is a probability statement based on the statistical characteristics of the investment and the shape of its distribution curve.
Types of Risk Management
Beta and Passive
One risk measure oriented to behavioral tendencies is a
drawdown
, which refers to any period during which an asset's return is negative relative to a previous high mark. In measuring drawdown, we attempt to address three things:
The magnitude of each negative period (how bad)
The duration of each (how long)
The frequency (how often)
For example, in addition to wanting to know whether a mutual fund beat the S&P 500, we also want to know its comparative risk. One measure for this is
beta
. Also called market risk, beta is based on the statistical property of
covariance
. A beta greater than 1 indicates more risk than the market while a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.
Beta helps us to understand the concepts of passive and
active risk
. The graph below shows a
time series
of returns (each data point labeled ""+"") for a particular portfolio R(p) versus the market return R(m). The returns are cash-adjusted, so the point at which the x and y-axes intersect is the cash-equivalent return. Drawing a
line of best fit
through the data points allows us to quantify the passive risk (beta) and the active risk (alpha).

The gradient of the line is its beta. So a gradient of 1 indicates that for every unit increase in market return, the portfolio return also increases by one unit. A money manager employing a passive management strategy can attempt to increase the
portfolio return
by taking on more market risk (i.e., a beta greater than 1) or alternatively decrease portfolio risk (and return) by reducing the portfolio beta below one.
Alpha and Active
If market or systematic risk were the only influencing factor, then a portfolio's return would always be equal to the beta-adjusted market return. But this isn't the case. Returns vary because of a number of factors unrelated to
market risk
. Investment managers who follow an active strategy take on other risks to achieve excess returns over the market's performance, including:
Tactics that
leverage
stock
Sector or country selection
Fundamental analysis
Position sizing
Technical analysis
Active managers hunt for an alpha, the measure of excess return. In our diagram example above, alpha is the amount of portfolio return not explained by beta, which is represented as the distance between the intersection of the x and y-axes and the y-axis intercept. This can be positive or negative.
In their quest for excess returns, active managers expose investors to
alpha risk
, the risk that the result of their bets will prove negative rather than positive. For example, a fund manager may think that the energy sector will outperform the S&P 500 and increase her portfolio's weighting in this sector. If unexpected economic developments cause energy stocks to sharply decline, the manager will likely underperform the benchmark.
The Cost of Risk
The more an active fund and its managers can generate alpha, the higher the fees they tend to charge. For purely passive vehicles like
index funds
or
exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
, you're likely to pay one to 10
basis points (bps)
in annual management fees. Investors may pay 200 bps in annual fees for a high-octane hedge fund with complex trading strategies, high capital commitments, and transaction costs. They may also have to give back 20% of the profits to the manager.
The pricing difference between passive (
beta risk
) and active strategies (alpha risk) encourages many investors to try and separate these risks, such as paying lower fees for the beta risk assumed and concentrating costly exposures to specifically defined alpha opportunities. This is popularly known as
portable alpha
, the idea that the alpha component of a total return is separate from the beta component.
For instance, a fund manager may claim to have an active
sector rotation
strategy for beating the S&P 500 with a track record of beating the index by 1.5% on an average annualized basis. This excess return is the manager's value (the alpha) and the investor is willing to pay higher fees to obtain it. The rest of the total return (what the S&P 500 itself earned) arguably has nothing to do with the manager's unique ability. Portable alpha strategies use derivatives and other tools to refine how they obtain and pay for the alpha and beta components of their
exposure
.
Example of Risk Management
During a 15-year period from Aug. 1, 1992, to July 31, 2007, the average
annualized total return
of the
S&P 500
was 10.7%. This number reveals what happened for the whole period, but it does not say what happened along the way.
The average standard deviation of the S&P 500 for that same period was 13.5%. This is the difference between the average return and the real return at most given points throughout the 15-year period.
When applying the bell curve model, any given outcome should fall within one standard deviation of the mean about 67% of the time and within two standard deviations about 95% of the time. Thus, an S&P 500 investor could expect the return, at any given point during this period, to be 10.7% plus or minus the standard deviation of 13.5% about 67% of the time. They may also assume a 27% (two standard deviations) increase or decrease 95% of the time. If they can afford the loss, they invest.
Why Is Risk Management Important?
Risk management is a key part of the investment and financial world. It requires investors and fund managers to identify, analyze, and make important decisions about the uncertainty that comes with reaching their goals. Risk management allows individuals to reach their goals while mitigating or dealing with any of the associated losses.
How Can I Practice Risk Management in Personal Finance?
There are a few different steps that individuals can take to practice risk management in their personal finances. Start by identifying your goals, and then highlight the risks associated with your objectives. Once you know what the risks are, evaluate them and research the best ways to manage these risks. You will likely have to monitor and make adjustments to ensure you stay on top of your goals.
How Do Companies Manage Their Operational Risk?
Operational risk is any risk associated with the day-to-day operations of a business. Companies can manage it by identifying and assessing potential risks, measuring them, and putting controls in place to either mitigate or eliminate them altogether. It's also important that corporations monitor their operations and risk management techniques to see if they are working and make changes whenever necessary.
The Bottom Line
Risk is an important part of the financial world. The word often brings up feelings of negativity since there is the potential for capital and investment loss. But risk isn't always bad because investments that have more risk often come with the biggest rewards. Knowing what the risks are, how to identify them, and employing suitable risk management techniques can help mitigate losses while you reap the rewards.

What is Behavioral Finance?
Behavioral finance
is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It also includes the subsequent effects on the markets. It focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases.
Traditional Financial Theory
In order to better understand behavioral finance, let’s first look at traditional financial theory.
Traditional finance includes the following beliefs:
Both the market and investors are perfectly rational
Investors truly care about utilitarian characteristics
Investors have perfect self-control
They are not confused by cognitive errors or information processing errors

Behavioral Finance Theory
Now let’s compare traditional financial theory with behavioral finance.
Traits of behavioral finance are:
Investors are treated as “normal” not “rational”
They actually have limits to their self-control
Investors are influenced by their own biases
Investors make cognitive errors that can lead to wrong decisions
Decision-Making Errors and Biases
Let’s explore some of the buckets or building blocks that make up behavioral finance.
Behavioral finance views investors as “normal” but being subject to decision-making biases and errors. We can break down the decision-making biases and errors into at least four buckets.

!
#1 Self-Deception
The concept of self-deception is a limit to the way we learn. When we mistakenly think we know more than we actually do, we tend to miss information that we need to make an informed decision.
#2 Heuristic Simplification
We can also scope out a bucket that is often called heuristic simplification. Heuristic simplification refers to information-processing errors.
#3 Emotion
Another behavioral finance bucket is related to emotion, but we’re not going to dwell on this bucket in this introductory session. Basically, emotion in behavioral finance refers to our making decisions based on our current emotional state. Our current mood may take our decision-making off track from rational thinking.
#4 Social Influence
What we mean by the social bucket is how our decision-making is influenced by others.
Top 10 Biases in Behavioral Finance
Behavioral finance seeks an understanding of the impact of personal biases on investors. Here is a list of common financial biases.
Common biases include:
Overconfidence and illusion of control
Self Attribution Bias
Hindsight Bias
Confirmation Bias
The Narrative Fallacy
Representative Bias
Framing Bias
Anchoring Bias
Loss Aversion
Herding Mentality
Overcoming Behavioral Finance Issues
There are ways to overcome negative behavioral tendencies in relation to investing. Here are some strategies you can use to guard against biases.
#1 Focus on the Process
There are two approaches to decision-making:
Reflexive
– Going with your gut, which is effortless, automatic and, in fact, is our default option
Reflective
– Logical and methodical, but requires effort to engage in actively
Relying on reflexive decision-making makes us more prone to deceptive biases and emotional and social influences.
Establishing logical decision-making processes can help protect you from such errors.
Get yourself focused on the process rather than the outcome. If you’re advising others, try to encourage the people you’re advising to think about the process rather than just the possible outcomes. Focusing on the process will lead to better decisions because the process helps you engage in reflective decision-making.
#2 Prepare, Plan and Pre-Commit
Behavioral finance teaches us to invest by preparing, by planning, and by making sure we pre-commit. Let’s finish with a quote from Warren Buffett.
“Investing success doesn’t correlate with IQ after you’re above a score of 25. Once you have ordinary intelligence, then what you need is the temperament to control urges that get others into trouble.”

What is Prospect Theory?
Prospect theory is a psychology theory that describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and
uncertainty
. It holds that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains.
Given the choice of equal probabilities, most people would choose to retain the wealth that they already have, rather than risk the chance to increase their current wealth. People are usually averse to the possibility of losing, such that they would rather avoid a loss rather than take a risk to make an equivalent gain.
History of Prospect Theory
The prospect theory is sometimes referred to as the
loss-aversion
theory. The theory was introduced by two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman, and Amos Tversky, to describe how humans make decisions when presented with several choices.
The theory was contained in the paper “
Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk
” that was published in the “Econometrica” journal in 1979. Since it was developed, the prospect theory’s been used in various disciplines. It is used to evaluate various aspects of political decision-making in international relations.
Phases of Prospect Theory
The theory describes the decision-making process in two phases, which include:
1. Editing phase
The editing phase refers to how people involved in decision-making characterize the options for choice or the framing effects. The effects explain how a person’s choice is influenced by the wording, order, or method in which the choices are presented.
An example to demonstrate the framing effect can be the choices that cancer patients are given. Usually, cancer patients are presented with the choice of undergoing surgery or chemotherapy to treat their illnesses, and they make a decision based on whether the outcome statistics are presented in terms of survival rates or mortality rates. Once the choices have been framed ready for decision-making, the theory enters the second phase.
2. Evaluation phase
In the evaluation phase, people tend to behave as if they would make a decision based on the potential outcomes and choose the option with a higher utility. The phase uses
statistical analysis
to measure and compare the outcomes of each prospect. The evaluation phase comprises two indices, i.e., the value function and the weighting function, which are used to compare the prospects.
Features of the Prospect Theory
The prospects theory comes with the following characteristics:
1. Certainty
When presented with several options to choose from, humans show a strong preference for the option with certainty. They are willing to sacrifice the option that offers more potential income in order to achieve more certainty. For example, assume that a lottery provides two options, A and B.
Option A provides a guaranteed win of $100 while option B provides the possibility of winning $200, with a 70% chance of winning and 30% chance of losing. Most people will choose option A since it provides a guaranteed win, even though it offers a lower return compared to B.
2. Small probabilities
People tend to discount very small probabilities even if there is a possibility of losing all their wealth. By discounting the small probabilities, people end up choosing higher-risk options with higher probabilities.
3. Relative positioning
Relative positioning means that people tend to focus less on their final income or wealth, and more on the relative gains or losses that they will get. If their relative position does not improve with increases in income, they will not feel better off. This means that people tend to compare themselves to their neighbors, friends, and family members, and are less interested in whether they are better off than they were some years back.
For example, if everybody in the office gets a 20% raise, no individual will feel better off. However, if the person gets a 10% raise, and other people fail to get a raise, that person will feel better off and richer than everyone else.
4. Loss aversion
People tend to give more weight to losses rather than gains made by taking a certain option. For example, if a person makes $200 in profits and $100 in losses, the person will focus on the loss even though they emerged with a $100 net gain. This shows that people are more concerned about losses rather than gains.
Criticism of Prospect Theory
One of the criticisms of the prospects theory is that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about. The criticism comes from other psychologists who notes that factors such as human emotional and affective responses that are important in the decision-making process are absent in the model.
The theory is also criticized for the inadequate framing theory that explains why actors generate the frames they use. Decision-makers often need to deal with competing frames across various issues.

What Is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act?
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress in response to financial industry behavior that led to the
financial crisis of 2007–2008
. It sought to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers.
Named for sponsors Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the act contains numerous provisions, spelled out over 848 pages, that were to be implemented over a period of several years.
Key Takeaways
The Dodd-Frank Act targeted financial system sectors that were believed to have caused the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
Leading up to 2007, lax regulations led to extremely risky lending practices, which caused a housing sector bubble that ultimately burst and drove the global crisis, the need for public bailouts of financial institutions, and the recession.
The institutions considered responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis included banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies.
Critics of the law argue that the regulatory burdens it imposes could make U.S. firms less competitive than their foreign counterparts.
In 2018, Congress passed a new law that rolled back some of Dodd-Frank’s restrictions.
Understanding the Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a massive piece of
financial reform legislation
that was passed in 2010, during the Obama administration.
Commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, or Dodd-Frank, it established a number of new government agencies tasked with overseeing the various components of the law and, by extension, various aspects of the
financial system
.
The 2007–2008 financial crisis is perhaps the worst economic catastrophe to befall the country (and the world) since the Wall Street crash in 1929. Broadly speaking, it was caused by greed-driven behavior and lax oversight of financial institutions.
The loosening of financial industry regulations in the decades leading up to 2007 allowed various types of institutions in the U.S. financial services industry to lend money in ways that were riskier than ever before. The housing sector in particular experienced massive growth that couldn't be supported.
The bubble burst, sending the banking industry and global stock markets into a downfall. It created the worst global recession in generations.
Dodd-Frank was created to keep anything similar from ever happening again.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2007–2008.
Components of the Dodd-Frank Act
Here are some of the law’s key provisions and how they work:
Financial Stability:
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the
Financial Stability Oversight Council
and the Orderly Liquidation Authority monitor the financial stability of major financial firms. The failure of these companies (deemed
too big to fail
) could have a serious negative impact on the U.S. economy. The law also provides for liquidations or restructurings via the Orderly Liquidation Fund. This fund was established to assist with the dismantling of financial companies that have been placed in receivership to prevent tax dollars from being used to prop up such firms. The council has the authority to break up banks that are considered so large as to pose
systemic risk
. It can also force banks to increase their reserve requirements. Similarly, the new
Federal Insurance Office
was tasked with identifying and monitoring insurance companies that were also considered too big to fail.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:
The
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
, established under Dodd-Frank, was given the job of preventing predatory mortgage lending and helping consumers understand the terms of a mortgage before agreeing to it. This reflected the widespread sentiment that the
subprime mortgage
market was the underlying cause of the 2007–2008 catastrophe. The CFPB deters mortgage brokers from earning higher commissions for closing loans with higher fees and/or higher interest rates. It requires that
mortgage originators
not steer potential borrowers to the loan that will result in the highest payment for the originator. The CFPB also governs other types of consumer lending, including credit and debit cards, and addresses consumer complaints. It requires lenders, excluding automobile lenders, to disclose information in a form that is easy for consumers to read and understand. Such an example is the simplified terms now on credit card applications.
Volcker Rule:
The
Volcker Rule
restricts how banks can invest, limits speculative trading, and eliminates
proprietary trading
. Banks are not allowed to be involved with hedge funds or private equity firms, which are considered too risky. To minimize possible conflicts of interest, financial firms are not allowed to trade proprietarily without sufficient ""skin in the game.” The Volcker Rule is clearly a pushback in the direction of the
Glass-Steagall Act
of 1933, which first recognized the inherent dangers of financial entities extending commercial and investment banking services at the same time. The act also contains a provision for regulating
derivatives
, such as the
credit default swaps
that were widely blamed for contributing to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Dodd-Frank set up centralized exchanges for swaps trading to reduce the possibility of counterparty default. It required greater disclosure of swaps trading information to increase transparency in those markets. The Volcker Rule also regulates financial firms’ use of derivatives in an attempt to prevent “too big to fail” institutions from taking large risks that might wreak havoc on the broader economy.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Office of Credit Ratings:
Dodd-Frank established the SEC Office of Credit Ratings because
credit rating
agencies had been accused of giving out misleading favorable investment ratings in the lead-up to the financial crisis. The office is charged with ensuring that agencies provide meaningful and reliable credit ratings of the businesses, municipalities, and other entities that they evaluate.
Whistleblower Program:
Dodd-Frank also strengthened and expanded the existing whistleblower program promulgated by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
of 2002. Specifically, it established a mandatory bounty program under which
whistleblowers
can receive from 10% to 30% of the proceeds from a litigation settlement, broadened the scope of a covered employee by including employees of a company’s subsidiaries and affiliates, and extended the statute of limitations under which whistleblowers can bring forward a claim against their employer from 90 to 180 days after a violation is discovered.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, he pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank. Siding with critics, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which rolled back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
It was signed into law by then-President Trump on May 24, 2018.
These are some of the provisions of that law, and some of the areas in which previous standards were loosened:
The new law eased the Dodd-Frank regulations for small and regional banks by increasing the asset threshold for the application of prudential standards,
stress test
requirements, and mandatory risk committees.
For institutions that have custody of clients’ assets but do not function as lenders or traditional bankers, the new law provided for lower
capital requirements
and leverage ratios.
The new law exempted escrow requirements for residential mortgage loans held by a depository institution or credit union under certain conditions. It also directed the
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
to set up standards for
Freddie Mac
and
Fannie Mae
to consider alternative credit scoring methods.
The law exempted lenders with assets of less than $10 billion from requirements of the Volcker Rule and imposed less stringent reporting and capital norms on small lenders.
The law required that the three major credit reporting agencies allow consumers to
freeze
their credit files free of charge as a way of deterring fraud.
After Joseph Biden was elected president in 2020, the CFPB focused on rescinding rules from the Trump era that were in direct conflict with the charter of the CFPB.
The Biden administration has also announced its intent to reestablish rules against other forms of predatory lending, such as
payday loans
, and on June 30, 2023, Bided signed a law to overturn the OCC's payday lending regulations.
Additionally,
subprime auto loan
practices are being addressed by the CFPB.
Criticism of the Dodd-Frank Act
Proponents of Dodd-Frank believed that the law would prevent the economy from experiencing a crisis like that of 2007–2008 and protect consumers from many of the abuses that contributed to the crisis.
Detractors, however, have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, they contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions, despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis.
Such financial world notables as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Blackstone Group L.P. (
BX
) CEO Stephen Schwarzman, activist Carl Icahn, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (
JPM
) CEO Jamie Dimon also argued that, while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints make for a more
illiquid
market overall.
The lack of liquidity can be especially potent in the bond market, where all securities are not
marked to market
and many bonds lack a constant supply of buyers and sellers. The higher
reserve
requirements under Dodd-Frank mean that banks must keep a higher percentage of their assets in cash. This decreases the amount that they are able to hold in marketable securities.
In effect, this limits the bond market-making role that banks have traditionally undertaken. With banks unable to play the part of a
market maker
, prospective buyers are likely to have a harder time finding counteracting sellers. More importantly, prospective sellers may find it more difficult to find counteracting buyers.
What Was the Purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act?
Dodd-Frank is intended to curb the extremely risky financial industry activities that led to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Its goal was, and still is, to protect consumers and taxpayers from egregious practices like predatory lending.
Is the Dodd-Frank Act Still in Effect?
Yes, it is; however, its regulatory strength was diluted with the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. Still, certain aspects, such as the bank stress tests it called for, are in use today. The Federal Reserve publishes stress test results regularly.
What Are Some Criticisms of the Dodd-Frank Act?
Detractors of the Dodd-Frank Act have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, critics contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions—despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis. Several financial world notables have also argued that, while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints also make for a more illiquid market overall.
What Was the Impact of the 2018 Rollback of Dodd-Frank Regulations?
In 2018, the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act rolled back numerous regulations put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Dodd-Frank rules, banks with $50 billion in assets were subject to more strenuous capital and liquidity requirements, but the new law in 2018 increased the asset threshold to $250 billion. This change relaxed the regulations for smaller and medium-sized banks. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March 2023, observers argued that the lack of regulatory scrutiny on financial institutions of this size played a key role in the bank's failure.
The Bottom Line
The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, was a direct response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing government bailouts under the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
.
This law established a wide range of reforms throughout the entire financial system, with the purpose of preventing a repeat of the 2007–2008 crisis and the need for further government bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act also included additional protections for consumers.
Although the Trump administration reversed and weakened several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly those affecting consumers, the Biden administration intends to reestablish and strengthen the previous reversals to protect individuals who may be subject to predatory lending practices in industries like for-profit education and automobiles.
